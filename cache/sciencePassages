Mice given the substance—alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG)—were healthier as they aged, and females lived longer than mice not on the supplement.</p><p>Other compounds, like the antiaging drug rapamycin and the diabetes treatment metformin, have shown similar effects in mouse experiments. But AKG is naturally made by mice and by our own bodies, and it is already considered safe to consume by regulators.</p><p>“The big thing about this is that its safety profile is so good,” says University of North Dakota aging researcher Holly Brown-Borg, who was not involved with the study. “It has potential and should be explored further, for sure.”</p><p>AKG is part of the metabolic cycle that our cells use to make energy from food. In addition to its use by bodybuilders, doctors sometimes treat osteoporosis and kidney disease with the supplement.</p><p>The molecule grabbed attention as a possible antiaging treatment in 2014, when researchers reported AKG could extend life span by more than 50% in tiny Caenorhabditis elegans worms. That’s on par with a low-calorie diet, which has been shown to promote healthy aging, but is hard for most people to stick with. Other groups later showed life span improvements from AKG in fruit flies.</p><p>In the new study, Gordon Lithgow and Brian Kennedy of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and colleagues turned to mammals. They gave groups of 18-month-old mice (about age 55 in human years) the equivalent of 2% of their daily chow as AKG until they died, or for up to 21 months. AKG levels in blood gradually drop with age, and the scientists’ aim was to restore levels to those seen in young animals.</p><p>Some differences jumped out within a few months: “They looked much blacker, shinier, and younger” than control mice, says Azar Asadi Shahmirzadi, a postdoc at the Buck Institute who did the experiments as a graduate student. In addition, the AKG-fed mice scored an average of more than 40% better on tests of “frailty,” as measured by 31 physiological attributes including hair color, hearing, walking gait, and grip strength. And female mice lived a median of 8% to 20% longer after AKG treatment began than control mice, the group reports today in Cell Metabolism.</p><p>The AKG-eating mice did not perform better on tests of heart function or treadmill endurance, however, and the tests did not include cognitive performance.</p><p>Probing the mechanism for these improvements, the researchers found that female mice receiving AKG produced higher levels of a molecule that tamps down on inflammation. Chronic inflammation can spur many diseases of aging such as cancer, heart disease, arthritis, and dementia.</p><p>The effects on life span and health were smaller for AKG than for some other antiaging compounds, notes aging researcher Matt Kaeberlein of the University of Washington, Seattle, who was not involved with the work. But some of those compounds have run into safety issues—for example, rapamycin suppresses the immune system and may promote diabetes.</p><p>Kennedy, now also at the National University of Singapore, plans to test AKG in human volunteers soon. Looking at a group of people between the ages of 45 and 65, his group will see whether the molecule improves aging-related biomarkers such as inflammation, arterial hardening, and a type of chemical signature on DNA associated with aging. The company Ponce de Leon Health, where Kennedy serves as chief scientific officer (and Gordon and other paper authors have stock), is running a similar study at Indiana University.</p><p>Ponce de Leon Health already sells a formulation of AKG called Rejuvant that it says can “slow the aging process.” Kennedy defends these claims. “We are upfront about the data that we have and do not yet have on the website,” he says. And Brown-Borg notes the Buck Institute team isn’t the first group of aging-focused researchers to start a company to develop an antiaging treatment, an idea she hopes will eventually pan out in clinical trials. “It’s an exciting time in the field,” she says.</p>\",\"date\":\"Aug. 27, 2020\",\"link\":\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/bodybuilding-supplement-promotes-healthy-aging-and-extends-life-span-least-mice\",\"discrp\":\"\\n      Bodybuilding supplement promotes healthy aging and extends life span, at least in mice      \\n  \\n      Alpha-ketoglutarate could be safer than other potential anti-aging treatments  \\n\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","{\"content\":\"<p>Rats and mice aren’t the only ones who can solve lab mazes. A new study suggests single-celled organisms—and even individual cancer cells—are just as adept, using chemical signals to find their way through complex mazes hundreds of times their size.\\n</p><p>Individual cells, whether cancer cells, skin cells, or single-celled organisms like bacteria, generally know where to go by sensing attractive chemicals in their environments and moving toward them, a process called chemotaxis. This basic type of navigation works best for short distances, generally less than half a millimeter. But when cells traverse longer, more complex paths, they can’t just passively follow a chemical gradient: They need to process the chemicals around them in real time to pick the best way forward.</p><p>To figure out how cells do this, researchers tested two known for going the distance—a soil-dwelling amoeba (Dictyostelium discoideum) and mouse pancreatic cancer cells. The researchers designed microscopic mazes with a pool of attractant chemicals at the end; they also filled the maze with the same chemicals so cells could build their own chemical trails. The miniature labyrinths had plenty of twists and turns—a perfect proxy for the complex path through soil or to a blood vessel.</p><p>Both cell types successfully maneuvered through the mazes, the researchers report today in Science, making it through various 0.85-millimeter-long mazes. The faster moving amoebas then tackled a longer one designed to mimic the famous Hampton Court Palace hedge maze outside of London (see video). Because the cancer cells moved so slowly, they likely would have perished during the longer journey.</p><p>By breaking down the chemicals as they moved through the maze, the first wave of amoeba cells was able to distinguish between the maze’s dead ends—which had limited amounts of the attractive chemical—and the correct path forward. But subsequent waves of cells weren’t so lucky. In nature, leading cells give off signals to their trailing counterparts to follow them. In the experiment, scientists modified cells to make such communication impossible. After the pioneers broke down the chemicals—essentially clearing them from the path—the stragglers were left unsure of where to go next. </p>\",\"date\":\"Aug. 27, 2020\",\"link\":\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/08/watch-amoebas-solve-microscopic-version-london-s-hampton-court-maze\",\"discrp\":\"\\n      Watch amoebas solve a microscopic version of London’s Hampton Court Maze      \\n  \\n      The cells break down chemicals to sense their surroundings  \\n\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","{\"content\":\"<p>Watch a human sperm under a microscope, and it will appear to swim like an eel wiggling its tail through the water.

When brought back to the lab and fed, they started to multiply. The microbes are oxygen-loving species that somehow exist on what little of the gas diffuses from the ocean surface deep into the seabed.</p><p>The discovery raises the “insane” possibility, as one of the scientists put it, that the microbes have been sitting in the sediment dormant, or at least slowly growing without dividing, for eons.</p><p>The new work demonstrates “microbial life is very persistent, and often finds a way to survive,” says Virginia Edgcomb, a microbial ecologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who was not involved in the work.</p><p>What’s more, by showing that life can survive in places biologists once thought uninhabitable, the research speaks to the possibility of life elsewhere in the Solar System, or elsewhere in the universe. “If the surface of a particular planet does not look promising for life, it may be holding out in the subsurface,” says Andreas Teske, a microbiologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who was also not involved with the new study.</p><p>Researchers have known that life exists “under the floorboards” of the ocean for more than 15 years. But geomicrobiologist Yuki Morono of the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology wanted to know the limits of such life. Microbes are known to live in very hot or toxic environments, but can they live where there’s little food to eat?</p><p>To find out, Morono and his colleagues mounted a drilling expedition in the South Pacific Gyre, a site of intersecting ocean currents east of Australia that is considered the deadest part of the world’s oceans, almost completely lacking the nutrients needed for survival. When they extracted cores of clay and other sediments from as deep as 5700 meters below sea level, they confirmed the samples did indeed contain some oxygen, a sign that there was very little organic material for bacteria to eat.</p><p>To explore what life might be there, Morono’s team carefully extracted small clay samples from the centers of the drilled cores, put them in glass vials, and added simple compounds, such as acetate and ammonium, that contained heavier forms—or isotopes—of nitrogen and carbon that could be detected in living microbes. On the day when the group first “fed” the mud samples with these compounds, and up to 557 days later, the team extracted bits of clay from the samples and dissolved it to spot any living microbes—despite the lack of food for them in the clay.</p><p>The work was challenging. Typically, there are at least 100,000 cells per cubic centimeter of seafloor mud. But in these samples, there were no more than 1000 bacteria in the same amount of sediment. So, the biologists had to develop specialized techniques such as using chemical tracers to detect whether any contaminating seawater got into the samples and developing a way to analyze very small amounts of cells and isotopes. “The preparation and care needed to do this work was really impressive,” says Kenneth Nealson, an environmental microbiologist retired from the University of Southern California.</p><p>The added nutrients woke up a variety of oxygen-using bacteria. In samples from the 101.5-million-year-old layer, the microbes increased by four orders of magnitude to more than 1 million cells per cubic centimeter after 65 days, the team reports today in Nature Communications.</p><p>Others have found bacteria in oxygenated sediments under the sea floor. Last year, William Orsi, a geobiologist at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich described living bacteria from 15-million-year-old sediments, a previous record. “But this study pushes it back by another order of magnitude in terms of geological time,” Orsi notes.</p><p>Genetic analysis of the microbes revealed they belonged to more than eight known bacterial groups, many of which are commonly found elsewhere in saltwater where they play important roles in breaking down organic matter. “It suggests that learning to survive under conditions of extreme energy limitation is a widespread ability,” Nealson says, one that may have evolved early, when there was not much for microbes to feed on. “It may have been a very handy survival trick.”</p><p>The researchers don’t know what the gyre microbes have been doing all these millions of years. Most of the species they found do not form spores, which are an inactive life stage that some bacteria form in unfavorable conditions. It could be the bacteria have been dividing very slowly all this time, which would make those isolated in this study the distant descendants of ancestors millions of years old.</p><p>But there’s so little food in the deep-sea sediments that any microbes there could most likely do little more than repair any damaged molecules. “If they are not dividing at all, they are living for 100 million years, but that seems insane,” says Steve D’Hondt, an oceanographer at the University of Rhode Island, Bay Campus, and co-author of the study. He wonders whether there’s another unrecognized source of energy—perhaps radioactivity—down there that allows slow division by the bacteria, which likely got trapped in these sediments as they were buried by other settling sediments.</p><p>But the bottom line, says Bo Barker Jørgensen, a marine microbiologist at Aarhus University who was not involved with the work, is “low food and energy seem not to set the ultimate limit for life on Earth.”</p>\",\"date\":\"Aug. 27, 2020\",\"link\":\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/scientists-pull-living-microbes-100-million-years-beneath-sea\",\"discrp\":\"\\n      Scientists pull living microbes, possibly 100 million years old, from beneath the sea      \\n  \\n      Bacteria 75 meters below the sea floor began to divide after a light snack  \\n\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","{\"content\":\"<p>At a recent symposium on the evolution of infectious diseases, University of California, San Diego (UCSD), pathologist Nissi Varki noted that humans suffer from a long list of deadly diseases—including typhoid fever, cholera, mumps, whooping cough,  and gonorrhea—that don’t afflict apes and most other mammals. All of those pathogens follow the same well-trodden pathway to break into our cells: They manipulate sugar molecules called sialic acids. Hundreds of millions of these sugars stud the outer surface of every cell in the human body—and the sialic acids in humans are different from those in apes.</p><p>Varki and an international team of researchers have now traced how evolution may have scrambled to construct new defenses after that molecular vulnerability emerged in our distant ancestors. By analyzing modern human genomes and ancient DNA from our extinct cousins, the Neanderthals and Denisovans, the researchers detected a burst of evolution in our immune cells that occurred in an ancestor of all three types of human by at least 600,000 years ago.</p><p>As the researchers report in the current issue of Genome Biology and Evolution, these genetic changes may have sharpened the body’s defenses against the pathogens that evolved to exploit sialic acids—but created new vulnerabilities. In an added irony, they note, humans’ distinctive sialic acids were themselves once a defense against disease. The evolutionary saga is a vivid illustration of the competition between humans and microbes, says microbiologist Christine Szymanski of the University of Georgia, Athens, who is not a co-author. “This gives us a human perspective on how we have to keep changing to keep pace.”\\n</p><p>The arena for this evolutionary arms race is the glycocalyx, a sugar coating that protects the outer membrane of all cells. It consists of a forest of molecules that sprout from the cell membrane. The sialic acids are at the tip of the tallest branches, sugar chains called glycans, which are rooted to fats and proteins deeper in the membrane.</p><p>Given their prominence and sheer number, sialic acids are usually the first molecules that invading pathogens encounter. Human cells are coated with one type of sialic acid, N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). But apes and most other mammals also carry a different one, N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc).</p><p>More than 2 million years ago, according to multiple molecular clock methods that estimate when mutations arose, a mutation in a gene on chromosome six made it impossible for human ancestors to make Neu5Gc anymore; instead, they made more of another sialic acid, Neu5Ac. “We now know we had an ancient complete makeover of the surface of the human cells,” says evolutionary biologist Pascal Gagneux of UCSD, a co-author of the new paper. Birds, some bats, ferrets, and New World monkeys all separately made the same evolutionary change.</p><p>The change likely evolved as a defense against malaria, says UCSD physician-scientist Ajit Varki, senior author of the paper and Nissi Varki’s spouse. Malarial parasites that infect chimpanzees were no longer able to bind with the altered sialic acids on our red blood cells.  </p><p>But in the next million years or so, that mutation became a liability, as Neu5Ac became a favorite portal for a flurry of other pathogens. At the infectious disease symposium organized by UCSD’s Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny, researchers described how multiple diseases evolved to use Neu5Ac to enter cells or to evade immune cells.</p><p>Coronaviruses appear to be no exception. “Most coronaviruses infect cells in two steps—first by recognizing abundant sialic acids as binding sites to gain a foothold, and then seeking out the higher affinity protein receptors like ACE2,” Ajit Varki says. “Think of it like an initial handshake or introduction that is required before one can ask for a date.” Two preprints suggest the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, also docks with sialic acids before binding with the ACE2 receptor to pierce human cells.</p><p>In past studies, Ajit Varki and Gagneux suggested the makeover of the cell and the loss of Neu5Gc may have even contributed to the origin of a new species in our genus Homo. If a woman with only Neu5Ac sialic acids mated with a man who still expressed Neu5Gc, her immune system may have rejected that man’s sperm or the fetus that developed from it. This fertility barrier might have helped divide Homo populations into different species more than 2 million years ago, the researchers speculated.</p><p>But the sialic acid change also sparked a new arms race between pathogens and our ancestors. In the new study, the researchers scanned DNA for immune genes in six Neanderthals, two Denisovans, and 1000 humans, and looked at dozens of chimps, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans as well. They found evolutionary changes that “markedly altered” one class of proteins—sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins, or Siglecs—that usually sit on the surface of human immune cells and recognize sialic acids.</p><p>Siglecs are molecular sentries: They probe sialic acids to see whether they are familiar parts of our own bodies or foreign invaders. If Siglecs spot sialic acids that are damaged or missing, they signal immune cells to activate, rousing an inflammatory army to attack potential invaders or clean up dam-aged cells. If sialic acids instead appear to be normal parts of our own cells, other, inhibitory Siglecs throttle back immune defenses so as not to attack our own tissues (see graphic, below).</p><p>The researchers identified functional changes in the DNA of eight out of 13 Siglecs encoded by genes on chromosome 19 in humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans. This hot spot of evolution appears only in Siglec gene variants, not in nearby genes on the chromosome, suggesting natural selection favored these changes, presumably because they helped fight pathogens that target Neu5Ac.</p><p>Apes did not show these changes, says first author Naazneen Khan, an evolutionary biologist now at the University of Kentucky. Given the mutations’ presence in archaic hominins, this burst of evolution must have happened before our lineages diverged 600,000 years ago, but after the mutation in that altered sialic acid arose more than 2 million years ago, perhaps in Homo erectus, thought to be an ancestor of modern humans and Neanderthals.</p><p>Most Siglecs are found on immune cells, but in the new paper, the team reports that several of the human Siglecs that underwent evolutionary changes are expressed in other types of human cells, including some in the placenta, cervix, pancreas, gut, and brain. Siglec changes may have been a side effect of intense battles with pathogens that infected these tissues, Nissi Varki suggests.</p><p>Although the recently mutated Siglecs protect us from pathogens, they may also contribute to other diseases. Some of the genetically changed Siglecs are associated with inflammation and autoimmune disorders such as asthma and with meningitis. The researchers suggest the altered Siglecs are constantly on high alert and do not dampen immune responses against our own tissues; they may even  make some individuals more prone to the runaway inflammation seen in severe COVID-19.</p><p>Other researchers say the work underscores broad evolutionary principles. “This nicely shows that … natural selection is not always going for the optimal solution, because the optimal solution is changing all the time,” says Rita Gerardy-Schahn, a glycobiologist at Hannover Medical School in Germany, who was not part of the new work. “What is best for natural selection in the short run may be the wrong selection tomorrow.”</p>\",\"date\":\"Aug. 27, 2020\",\"link\":\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/ancient-microbial-arms-race-sharpened-our-immune-system-also-left-us-vulnerable\",\"discrp\":\"\\n      Ancient microbial arms race sharpened our immune system—but also left us vulnerable      \\n  \\n      Study traces genetic responses to pathogens back more than 600,000 years to the ancestor of Neanderthals and humans  \\n\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","{\"content\":\"<p>The genetic code in mammals may have gained another letter—or at least a significant footnote. Textbooks speak of four DNA building blocks, whose order specifies genes. But researchers in the field of epigenetics have also identified four chemically modified versions of these nucleotide bases, which affect how genes are expressed. Three of them are altered versions of cytosine, one of the original four bases. The last, methylated adenine, is mired in controversy about whether it exists in mammals.</p><p>Now, researchers at Yale University have not only identified plenty of this modified base in mouse embryonic cells, but also found it plays a key role in the development of the placenta. The methylated base—methyladenine for short—gives cells another epigenetic tool for turning genes on or off during normal development or in disease. “This is a very important study for our understanding of the role of [methylated adenine] in gene regulation,” says Peng Jin, a geneticist at Emory University who was not part of the work.</p><p>Animal cells often add methyl or other chemical groups to a cytosine to help switch a gene on or off, whereas bacteria rely heavily on methylation of adenines. But in the past 5 years, researchers have also detected methyladenines in fruit flies, nematode worms, and frogs. Hints of the modified base also turned up in mammals. “If [they] exist, it’s an exciting new layer of biology,” says Eric Greer, an epigeneticist at Harvard University.\\n</p><p>But the reported levels were minuscule, and Greer and others found that many “detections” were the result of bacterial DNA contaminating samples, equipment, and even commercially available enzymes used in experiments. “It’s difficult to rule out contamination by bacterial DNAs,” agrees molecular biologist Ying Liu of Peking University, who has studied methyladenine in nematodes.</p><p>In addition, an antibody sequencing technique that the new study and others have used is often not specific enough to isolate these bases, picking up methylated adenines in RNA as well as in DNA. “The reality is, the techniques we have are not robust enough,” says Colm Nestor, a molecular geneticist at Linköping University.</p><p>But Yale epigeneticist Andrew Xiao persisted. In 2018, his team found methyladenine in high amounts in human glioblastoma cells, where it seemed to affect the growth of this brain cancer. The researchers showed that when they inhibited a protein that removes adenine’s methyl groups, causing methyladenine to accumulate, tumor growth slowed.</p><p>Earlier this month in Nature, Xiao, epigeneticist Haitao Li at Tsinghua University, and their colleagues reported that they have found the modified base in normal mouse cells: the trophoblast stem cells, which eventually give rise to the placenta. The methyladenines are prevalent at places in DNA called M/SAR regions, which help create temporary “compartments” dividing active and inactive regions of the genome. As these compartments form, DNA’s double helix unwinds briefly.</p><p>Using the antibody sequencing methods and taking precautions to avoid the known specificity issues with methyladenine, Xiao and his colleagues discovered that methyladenines in unwound DNA prevent the binding of the SATB1 protein needed to rewind the DNA. The unwinding in turn blocks the expression of genes that would make trophoblast stem cells differentiate and stop growing. Instead, the cells multiply, ensuring there are enough of them to make the full placenta. Later, the methyls are removed—the researchers don’t know how—and the cells start specializing to make the placenta.</p><p>The same process may govern placental development in humans—and disrupt embryonic growth and development when it goes awry—says Indira Mysorekar, a reproductive biologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. “The paper is exciting.”</p><p>Researchers pursuing methyladenine also see it as vindication. “It provides one of the best supports so far of [the importance of methyladenine] in a mammalian system,” says Chuan He, a biochemist at the University of Chicago.

The event was a bit different this year, of course, because of the coronavirus pandemic. Only 10 people competed, and there was no live audience. But Joey “Jaws” Chestnut still managed to set a world record, scarfing down 75 hot dogs (buns included) in 10 minutes.</p><p>Surprisingly—and perhaps a bit horrifyingly—he could have eaten a few more. In a new study, a researcher calculates that a human could theoretically devour 83 hot dogs in 10 minutes—a rate of consumption similar to that of a grizzly bear chowing down on animal flesh.</p><p>James Smoliga came up with the idea for the study while reading about research on track and field performance. Scientists have tried to estimate human limits for athletic events such as the marathon or 100-yard dash using data from past record holders, says Smoliga, a physiologist at High Point University. While reading a paper on the limits of human running speed, he thought, “I bet the hot dog competition is similar to this.”\\n</p><p>Smoliga turned to a mathematical model created by Mark Denny, a biologist at Stanford University. Denny used the model to estimate the maximum possible running speeds of dogs, horses, and humans. By finding a mathematical function that fits data points from past world records in a certain event (in this case, hot dog eating) over time, Denny says, one can then predict performance limits in that event.</p><p>Thankfully for Smoliga, competitive eating enthusiasts have diligently documented their feats over the years. Combining those self-collected data points with information from the Nathan’s Famous website, he pulled together 39 years of data, ending in 2019. (Though the contest began in 1972, consistent competition times of 10 to 12 minutes began in the early ’80s.)</p><p>The winning number of hot dogs has ballooned, Smoliga found, from 10 in 1980 to a gargantuan 74 in 2018–the previous record, also held by Chestnut. “We haven’t gotten twice as fast in the 100 meters or twice as fast in the marathon over 100 years,” Smoliga says. “It doesn’t compare to anything else that we’ve seen in sports.”</p><p>These skyrocketing numbers are likely due to competitors stepping up their training, he says, by practicing downing large amounts of food or water in a limited time. The goal is to train the stomach to relax and rapidly stretch, allowing these professional eaters to “take in this enormous volume that most people can’t,” says David Metz, a gastroenterologist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.</p><p>In 2007, Metz documented this impressive (or appalling) stomach expansion in a competitive eater. In one test, a competitive eater guzzled 4.5 liters of water in just 2 minutes, whereas a person with no competitive eating experience drank less than 2 liters.</p><p>While shaving off one-tenth of a second in the 100-meter dash depends on complex processes in the cardiovascular, muscular, and skeletal systems, stretching one’s stomach is simpler, Smoliga says. (He compares it to using progressively larger earrings to slowly expand earlobes, though the stomach can more easily contract back to its normal size.) That could explain the rapid increase in winning hot dog counts in a relatively short time.</p><p>And there’s still room for improvement, Smoliga found. According to his calculations, a human being should be able to swallow up to 83 hot dogs in 10 minutes, he reports today in Biology Letters.</p><p>Denny cautions, however, that math alone isn’t enough because equations do not account for physiological factors. In particular, Metz adds, research is slim on the physiology of competitive eaters, so there are still many unknowns, including the maximum capacity of the human stomach.</p><p>And he cautions the public not to try to find out for themselves. An amateur eater could suffer serious health consequences trying to ingest a humongous volume, he warns, potentially choking or rupturing their stomach.

The tool, which worked in lab experiments with human cells, could open the door to new studies of—and one day therapies for—dozens of hard-to-treat diseases caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). These rare conditions, which include Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and lethal infantile cardiomyopathy, collectively affect about one in 4000 people. Until now, research on these illnesses has been stymied in part because there was no way of reproducing the mutations in strains of mice.</p><p>The new DNA editor is “quite innovative and pioneering,” says Joseph Hacia, a medical geneticist at the University of Southern California. “It’s highly likely that it will work in mice, and I’m hopeful that it will have therapeutic implications down the line.”</p><p>Thousands of mitochondria, which likely evolved from bacteria, exist in most every human cell, and each contains its own genes.

One difficulty is that a key component of the most famous genome editor, CRISPR, is too large to enter mitochondria. And other genome editors that can reach mtDNA do not have the subtlety to correct point mutations.</p><p>To create the new tool, which combines features of CRISPR and an older technology called transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs), three teams joined forces. “Part of what made the project so fun to work on, and ultimately successful, is the fact that three labs came together organically because the science led us to each other,” says David Liu, a chemist at the Broad Institute and the last author of a paper that describes the work in Nature today.</p><p>The first step toward that collaboration was a finding by Marcos de Moraes, a postdoc working in a University of Washington, Seattle, lab run by microbiologist Joseph Mougous.

The event was a bit different this year, of course, because of the coronavirus pandemic. Only 10 people competed, and there was no live audience. But Joey “Jaws” Chestnut still managed to set a world record, scarfing down 75 hot dogs (buns included) in 10 minutes.</p><p>Surprisingly—and perhaps a bit horrifyingly—he could have eaten a few more. In a new study, a researcher calculates that a human could theoretically devour 83 hot dogs in 10 minutes—a rate of consumption similar to that of a grizzly bear chowing down on animal flesh.</p><p>James Smoliga came up with the idea for the study while reading about research on track and field performance. Scientists have tried to estimate human limits for athletic events such as the marathon or 100-yard dash using data from past record holders, says Smoliga, a physiologist at High Point University. While reading a paper on the limits of human running speed, he thought, “I bet the hot dog competition is similar to this.”</p><p>Smoliga turned to a mathematical model created by Mark Denny, a biologist at Stanford University. Denny used the model to estimate the maximum possible running speeds of dogs, horses, and humans. By finding a mathematical function that fits data points from past world records in a certain event (in this case, hot dog eating) over time, Denny says, one can then predict performance limits in that event.</p><p>Thankfully for Smoliga, competitive eating enthusiasts have diligently documented their feats over the years. Combining those self-collected data points with information from the Nathan’s Famous website, he pulled together 39 years of data, ending in 2019. (Though the contest began in 1972, consistent competition times of 10 to 12 minutes began in the early ’80s.)</p><p>The winning number of hot dogs has ballooned, Smoliga found, from 10 in 1980 to a gargantuan 74 in 2018–the previous record, also held by Chestnut. “We haven’t gotten twice as fast in the 100 meters or twice as fast in the marathon over 100 years,” Smoliga says. “It doesn’t compare to anything else that we’ve seen in sports.”</p><p>These skyrocketing numbers are likely due to competitors stepping up their training, he says, by practicing downing large amounts of food or water in a limited time. The goal is to train the stomach to relax and rapidly stretch, allowing these professional eaters to “take in this enormous volume that most people can’t,” says David Metz, a gastroenterologist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.</p><p>In 2007, Metz documented this impressive (or appalling) stomach expansion in a competitive eater. In one test, a competitive eater guzzled 4.5 liters of water in just 2 minutes, whereas a person with no competitive eating experience drank less than 2 liters.</p><p>While shaving off one-tenth of a second in the 100-meter dash depends on complex processes in the cardiovascular, muscular, and skeletal systems, stretching one’s stomach is simpler, Smoliga says. (He compares it to using progressively larger earrings to slowly expand earlobes, though the stomach can more easily contract back to its normal size.) That could explain the rapid increase in winning hot dog counts in a relatively short time.</p><p>And there’s still room for improvement, Smoliga found. According to his calculations, a human being should be able to swallow up to 83 hot dogs in 10 minutes, he reports today in Biology Letters.</p><p>Denny cautions, however, that math alone isn’t enough because equations do not account for physiological factors. In particular, Metz adds, research is slim on the physiology of competitive eaters, so there are still many unknowns, including the maximum capacity of the human stomach.</p><p>And he cautions the public not to try to find out for themselves. An amateur eater could suffer serious health consequences trying to ingest a humongous volume, he warns, potentially choking or rupturing their stomach. Simply put, he says, “They shouldn’t try this at home.”</p>\",\"date\":\"Sep. 15, 2020\",\"link\":\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/how-many-hot-dogs-can-person-really-scarf-down-10-minutes\",\"discrp\":\"\\n      How many hot dogs can a person really scarf down in 10 minutes?      \\n  \\n      Study suggests competitive eaters have yet to reach the body’s limit  \\n\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","{\"content\":\"<p>In a biological beating of swords into plowshares, researchers have converted a bacterial toxin into a genome editing tool that, for the first time, can make precise changes to DNA in mitochondria, the cell’s power plants. The tool, which worked in lab experiments with human cells, could open the door to new studies of—and one day therapies for—dozens of hard-to-treat diseases caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).

Researchers say the results, released today in six papers in Nature and 17 in other journals, could pave the way for full genome sequencing of all patients’ tumors. Such sequences could then be used in efforts to match each patient to a molecular treatment.</p><p>The Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project, which had a cast of more than 1300 scientists and clinicians around the world, analyzed 2658 whole genomes for 38 types of cancer, from breast to liver. “What stands out from these studies is the rigor of doing this in a systemic way,” says cancer geneticist Marcin Cieslik, who with colleague Arul Chinnaiyan at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, co-authored a commentary on the papers.</p><p>Previous published studies—such as those from the U.S.-funded Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)—originally looked only at the “exome,” protein-coding DNA that make up just 1% of the genome, of tumors because it was cheaper and easier. But this shortcut left out many changes that might drive cancer growth. With DNA sequencing costs falling, the TCGA and the International Cancer Genome Consortium turned to the entire genome about 10 years ago, sequencing all 3 billion DNA base pairs, including regulatory regions within noncoding DNA, for many tumor samples. These groups also looked for large rearrangements and other structural changes that exome sequencing misses.</p><p>The PCAWG study’s 1300-strong team then dug into the data, which the other groups had made freely available in databases. Its analysis didn’t find many new so-called “driver” mutations within genes or noncoding DNA that power cell growth in tumors. But the researchers found “many more ways … to change those pathways” of cancer growth, said project member Lincoln Stein of the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research during a press call. For example, about one-fifth of the tumors had cells in which chromosomes shattered and rearranged, a bizarre phenomenon known as chromothripsis.  </p><p>Each tumor had four to five driver mutations on average. In all, the PCAWG project was able to find at least one driver mutation in about 95% of the tumor samples, compared with just 67% with exome sequencing, says Peter Campbell of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, another project member. This means many more cancer patients can in principle now be matched to a drug that targets the protein made by that driver gene.</p><p>One PCAWG team also figured out how to trace the evolution of the mutations in a single tumor biopsy. The group confirmed that the initial mutations often cropped up years or decades before the cancers were diagnosed, suggesting many could be detected and treated much earlier. Another team found new patterns of mutations that result from environmental exposures such as tobacco smoke. The papers in other journals explore topics such as how often tumor genomes contain DNA from viruses that may have triggered the cancer (13% of the samples).</p><p>Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, are moving toward whole-genome sequencing of every cancer patient’s tumor to guide treatment; the full cost is still thousands of dollars per genome, Campbell says. The PCAWG analysis could be “a blueprint for these national programs,” he says. The PCAWG consortium has also begun to pool clinical records and genomes for 100,000 patients to create a “knowledge bank” that doctors could consult to determine the best treatment based on a patient’s tumor genome.</p><p>Cieslik and Chinnaiyan note that most of the same information could be gleaned by combining exome data with cheaper tests such as RNA sequencing and assays for rearrangements. “Whether whole-genome sequencing is ultimately the best method in the clinic remains to be seen,” Cieslik says. But the wealth of data from the PCAWG study, which is now freely available to researchers, will help biologists understand the mechanisms of cancer, they say.</p><p>Another caveat is that although targeted drugs can be less toxic and more powerful than chemotherapy, most patients’ tumors grow back as a few cells that resist the drug begin to expand. The patient may then need another drug to kill the resistant cells. “It’s certainly true that this kind of sequencing will not mean that all cancers are cured,” Campbell says. “But it points us to where we should be thinking about developing drugs for preventing resistance or treating it once it arises.” </p>\",\"date\":\"Apr. 22, 2020\",\"link\":\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/02/massive-cancer-genome-study-reveals-how-dna-errors-drive-tumor-growth\",\"discrp\":\"\\n      Massive cancer genome study reveals how DNA errors drive tumor growth      \\n  \\n      Analysis of 2600 tumors could help match cancer patients to targeted treatments  \\n\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","{\"content\":\"<p>Glance at an intricately structured blob of human brain cells in a lab dish, and it’s tempting to dub it a “minibrain.” That’s the popular term for cerebral organoids, complex 3D tissues made from stem cells that are revolutionizing how researchers study neural development and conditions from autism to Zika. But the most comprehensive genetic comparison yet of cells from real brains and cerebral organoids, published today, reveals important differences between them.</p><p>Arnold Kriegstein, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco, and his colleagues first cataloged the genes turned on in individual cells from different parts of human fetal brains at 6 to 22 weeks of gestation. They then compared these patterns of gene expression to those of cells from cerebral organoids created using several previously published methods.</p><p>When it came to broad categories of brain cells—like neurons and nonneuronal cells called glia—the gene expression generally matched up. But when the researchers examined more precise subtypes of cells—a subset cells known as outer radial glia, for example—the comparisons started to break down. The organoid cells weren’t reliably maturing and expressing the specific combinations of genes that distinguish one subtype of cell from another.\\n</p><p>That’s a potential limitation for studies that use organoids to model disease. Many such studies “reprogram” cells from a person with a disease into stem cells that can form an organoid. But nervous system diseases are highly cell-type specific, says Kriegstein, making it hard to draw conclusions about the disease if your lab-grown model doesn’t contain the exact cell type affected in the brain.</p><p>Though the organoid cells didn’t generally mature into precise subtypes, they did become specialized in another way: They took on genetic signatures that correspond to different regions of the brain. But those identities came on unpredictably. Signatures that you’d expect to see on opposite sides of the brain were sometimes right next to each other in an organoid, the team found. That could complicate studies of certain diseases, says Kriegstein, such as a form of dementia that affects only particular brain regions.</p><p>So why don’t organoids perfectly reproduce the cell types of the brain? Kriegstein’s team suggests a key factor is the stress of growing in a dish instead of a body. The organoid cells expressed genetic markers of metabolic stress, but this expression was reduced when the cells were grafted into a mouse brain. What’s more, this relocation seemed to help resolve these cells’ identity crisis, the team reports in Nature; it prompted them to take on the genetic signatures of the more developed cell types in the human brain.</p><p>That means there might be ways to make organoids more brainlike by tweaking the broth of nutrients used to nourish them in a dish, says Madeline Lancaster, a developmental geneticist at the Medical Research Council’s Laboratory of Molecular Biology. For example, researchers often culture organoids in high concentrations of glucose, “equivalent to a very, very diabetic person,” she says. “You could imagine this may not be very good for a developing brain.”</p><p>Future studies might also reduce the unnaturally high levels of oxygen present in lab conditions, says Flora Vaccarino, a developmental biologist at Yale University. That’s a relatively easy variable to tweak, she says, using incubators that control how much oxygen flows to the organoid cells.</p><p>It’s no surprise that organoids don’t perfectly replicate the human brain, she says. But the new study lays out how you can “convince yourself that you have a valid model of human development,” she says. “It gives a very optimistic message.”</p>\",\"date\":\"Apr. 22, 2020\",\"link\":\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/lab-grown-minibrains-differ-real-thing-cell-subtypes-gene-expression\",\"discrp\":\"\\n      Lab-grown ‘minibrains’ differ from the real thing in cell subtypes, gene expression      \\n  \\n      Stress prompts important differences between organoid and human brain cells  \\n\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","{\"content\":\"<p>Venomous snakes kill or permanently injure more than a half-million people every year. Yet researchers still know surprisingly little about the biology behind venom, complicating efforts to develop treatments. A new advance could help: Researchers have successfully grown miniature organs from snake stem cells in the lab that function just like snake venom glands; they even produce real venom.</p><p>“It’s a breakthrough,” says José María Gutiérrez, a snake venom toxicologist at the University of Costa Rica, San José, who was not involved in the study. “This work opens the possibilities for studying the cellular biology of venom-secreting cells at a very fine level, which has not been possible in the past.” The advance could also help researchers study the venom of rare snakes that are difficult to keep in captivity, he says, paving the way for new treatments for a variety of venoms.</p><p>Researchers have been creating miniorgans—or organoids—from adult human and mouse stem cells for years. These so-called pluripotent cells are able to divide and grow into new types of tissues throughout the body; scientists have coaxed them into tiny livers, guts, and even rudimentary brains. But scientists hadn’t tried the technique with reptile cells before.\\n</p><p>“Nobody knew anything about stem cells in snakes,” says Hans Clevers, a molecular biologist at the Hubrecht Institute and one of the world’s leading organoid scientists. “We didn’t know if it was possible at all.” To find out, Clevers and colleagues removed stem cells from the venom glands of nine snake species—including the cape coral cobra and the western diamondback rattlesnake—and placed them in a cocktail of hormones and proteins called growth factors.</p><p>To the team’s surprise, the snake stem cells responded to the same growth factors that work on human and mouse cells. This suggests certain aspects of these stem cells originated hundreds of millions of years ago in a shared ancestor of mammals and reptiles.</p><p>By the end of 1 week submerged in the cocktail, the snake cells had grown into little clumps of tissue, a half-millimeter across and visible to the human eye. When the scientists removed the growth factors, the cells began to morph into the epithelial cells that produce venom in the glands of snakes. The miniorgans expressed similar genes as those in real venom glands, the team reports today in Cell.</p><p>The snake organoids even produced venom; a chemical and genetic analysis of the secretions revealed that they match the venom made by the real snakes. The labmade venom is dangerous as well: It disrupted the function of mouse muscle cells and rat neurons in a similar way to real venom.</p><p>Scientists didn’t know whether the many toxins found in snake venom are made by one general type of cell or specialized, toxin-specific cells. By sequencing RNA in individual cells and examining gene expression, Clevers’s team determined that both real venom glands and organoids contain different cell types that specialize in producing certain toxins. Organoids grown using stem cells from separate regions of the venom gland also produce toxins in different proportions, indicating that location within the organ matters.</p><p>The proportions and types of toxins in venom differ among—and even within—species. “That can be problematic for antivenom production,” says study author Yorick Post, a molecular biologist at the Hubrecht Institute. Most antivenoms are developed using one type of venom, so they only work against one type of snakebite.</p><p>Now that Clevers and his colleagues created a way to study the complexity of venom and venom glands without handling live, dangerous snakes, they plan to compile a “biobank” of frozen organoids from venomous reptiles around the world that could help researchers find broader treatments. “This would make it much easier to create antibodies,” Clevers says. The biobank could also be a “rich resource for identifying new drugs,” he adds. (Scientists think snake venom may hold the key for treatments against pain, high blood pressure, and cancer, for instance.)</p><p>Another new study, published earlier this month in Nature, could also help. Researchers have assembled a near-complete genome for the Indian cobra that could aid drug development.

One of the first came in 1962 after LMB researchers, having pioneered x-ray crystallography, used the technique to decipher the first atomic structures for proteins—those of myoglobin and hemoglobin, which carry oxygen in muscle tissue and blood. X-ray crystallography has dominated structural biology ever since, but it has an Achilles’ heel: Some proteins just can’t be coaxed to form crystals, which scatter x-rays to reveal structure.</p><p>One of LMB’s most recent Nobel laureates is Richard Henderson, an unassuming Scotsman who slouches in his office chair in socks and sandals, surrounded by mountains of paperwork. In 2017, Henderson won a share of the chemistry prize for his work in developing detectors for cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The technique, also pioneered at LMB, is the brash upstart in structural biology, challenging crystallography in resolution and surpassing it in purview: It opens up far more proteins to inspection and captures many more of their natural configurations.</p><p>Cryo-EM dodges the problem of crystallization with a flash-freezing process that fixes proteins in thin films of glassy ice. Then, an electron microscope takes thousands of 2D snapshots of the proteins caught in random orientations. A computer stitches them together to reveal the 3D structure, so important in understanding how a protein works—and how a drugmaker might target it.</p><p>But cryo-EM has a big problem of its own: long waits to use extraordinarily expensive microscopes. Moreover, tricky sample preparation means that even when researchers get access, much of their time ends up wasted. “There’s this dirty little secret of the field,” says LMB physicist Chris Russo. “It’s almost as hard as making a crystal. There’s a lot of trial and error in it.”</p><p>Some researchers are aiming to fix those problems with automation: robots that can make icy protein samples more reliably and with less waste. Other scientists are developing materials that protect protein molecules during freezing. Still others are working on software that could gather data more efficiently.</p><p>But Henderson sees those efforts as mere Band-Aids. For him, what holds back the technique is the forbidding cost of a microscope. Henderson, Russo, and a small group of confederates are trying to make cryo-EM affordable.</p><p>A top machine costs about $7 million. Preparing a room and installing a microscope can cost just as much. Then come the operational costs—a torrent of electricity, dedicated troubleshooting staff—that can rise to $10,000 per day.</p><p>Roughly 130 Krios machines—the microscopes widely considered the best—have been sold by Thermo Fisher Scientific and installed around the world. LMB has the luxury of three for a relatively small staff, and yet even its researchers must wait a month or more to get time.</p><p>Most structural biologists have no access at all. “The wait can be from 3 months to infinity,” says Bridget Carragher, codirector of the Simons Electron Microscopy Center in New York City, a mecca for cryo-EM. “It’s becoming the haves and the have-nots.”</p><p>No one complains about the quality of the Krios machines, which take months to assemble by hand from thousands of parts in a Dutch factory. They are Cadillacs. But science would benefit from something less posh, Henderson says. “We need a people’s cryo-EM for maybe 10 times less: a Volkswagen Beetle.”</p><p>For decades, microscopists have opted for machines that run at high energies and require expensive parts and precautions. After revisiting the basic physics, Henderson, Russo, and colleagues showed that a cheaper, lower-energy microscope can take pictures that are just as good, if not better.</p><p>Now, Henderson hopes to persuade manufacturers to make his cut-rate machine. At less than $1 million, it should put cryo-EM within reach of thousands of labs. Doing so would democratize the field, he says, and accelerate the discovery of protein structures. At the very least, Carragher says, researchers could use a cheap machine to screen out bad samples, preventing wasted time on a Krios. “People need to learn the trade and try things out,” she says. “They shouldn’t be doing it on the glamour machine.”</p><p>CRYO-EM’S RISE SEEMS unstoppable. At first, researchers worried that the technique could not go small enough: Before 2010, it could attain resolutions below 4 angstroms—four times the diameter of a hydrogen atom—only for a few symmetric, easy-to-solve structures. But machines like the Krios, along with new detectors that record the path of pertinent electrons before the electron beam fries the sample, have changed the game. In the best cases, researchers can now make maps with resolutions below 2 angstroms, putting cryo-EM on par with crystallography.</p><p>Cryo-EM also has distinct advantages over the older technique. Consider the study of the cell’s gatekeepers, membrane proteins, which are drugmakers’ most popular targets. The proteins are tough to crystallize because they flex to let things in and out of the cell. Crystallographers must put them in chemical straitjackets to stabilize them and get them to crystallize. But doing that means losing valuable information about how a floppy protein functions, says Melanie Ohi, a structural biologist at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.</p><p>By contrast, cryo-EM can freeze proteins in any of their shapes, showing how they act. This year, for example, Sriram Subramaniam, a structural biologist at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, and colleagues used cryo-EM to obtain snapshots of Cas9, the enzymatic scissors of CRISPR gene editing, as it snipped and cut DNA. A protein “is not a single, static thing,” he says. “Cryo-EM tells you the story of how things work.”</p><p>X-ray crystallography isn’t going away anytime soon: It is buttressed by the sunk costs of billion-dollar synchrotrons, government-owned facilities that supply bright x-ray beams for crystallographers and other users. But trends at the Protein Data Bank, a repository of protein structures, reflect cryo-EM’s growing popularity (see chart). The number of proteins solved by x-rays peaked in 2017, whereas the number of cryo-EM solutions is nearly doubling every year. Cryo-EM will soon surpass x-rays, predicts Jim Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute, a biological imaging center that will open in 2021 in Didcot, U.K., and will task many of its 200 researchers with improving cryo-EM methods. “In 5 years or less, EM will be the dominant method,” he says. At LMB, it already is: The lab crossed that threshold in 2016.</p><p>To alleviate some of the pent-up demand for access, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 2018 announced $130 million in grants to establish cryo-EM centers in New York, California, and Oregon, each with a few Krios machines. As with synchrotrons, time on the machines at those centers is freely available to researchers. Users simply arrive with their frozen samples—or ship them—and cross their fingers for good data.</p><p>Yet many leave empty-handed, says Claudia López, co-director of the cryo-EM center at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). “You can have the best microscope in the world, but if your sample is no good, there’s nothing you can do about it,” she says.</p><p>It’s not just the chanciness of sample preparation; it’s also the lack of access that frustrates Claudio Grosman, a biophysicist at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, who studies a membrane protein in muscle cells and neurons that binds to nicotine and other drugs. He is waiting to see whether he will get time at the Simons Center, which has added four NIH-funded Krios machines to three existing ones. “I am used to being limited by my own skills in my lab, by my own capacity to read and understand the literature,” he says. “It’s hard to compete with these labs that have a cryo-EM machine in their basement.”</p><p>Even with seven machines, Carragher says queues at the Simons Center are long and fretful. “Everyone wants more time,” she says, “everybody thinks they’re not getting enough.”</p><p>IT’S EASY TO SEE WHY. At LMB in July 2019, postdoc Byung-Gil Lee finally had time on a Krios after weeks of waiting—and weeks of purifying a protein until hundreds of trillions of copies were concentrated in a single drop. The object of his desire: cohesin, a protein involved in cell division that is defective in many cancers. Only bits of its structure have been solved with crystallography, and Lee had just 24 hours to try for a better picture using cryo-EM.</p><p>With a pipette, he beaded the solution onto 10 sample holders, each the size of a flea. Then he froze them in a flash, as a robot plunged them into a bath of liquid ethane. He held a hair dryer up to a dentist’s palette of tiny tools and blasted away residual water, which could contaminate the samples. With tweezers, he slotted the sample holders into a rack and doused it in hissing liquid nitrogen to keep the samples frozen. He loaded the rack into the humming Krios towering behind him. An unseen mechanism slipped it into a bright beam of electrons accelerated to three-quarters the speed of light.</p><p>Swiveling to a computer command station, Lee fiddled with knobs and a joystick to zoom in. Splotches and blank spots on the sample holder, or grid, indicated that the thin films of ice didn’t completely form. “I don’t think this grid has good ice,” he says. “This is common.”</p><p>Lee ultimately found that just three of his 10 sample holders were worth inspecting. He didn’t get enough snapshots for the computer to build up a 3D picture of the protein. He had to get back in the queue and wait for more microscope time.</p><p>How best to tackle such problems? One remedy is to be thriftier with samples of proteins, which are time-consuming and expensive to make and then casually wasted. Typically, researchers use pipettes to apply microliters of the protein solution to sample holders and blot away the excess with filter paper. In 2016, Carragher and colleagues reported developing a dispenser that sprays the solution like an inkjet printer, releasing picoliters instead of microliters—only one-millionth as much.</p><p>Naismith wants to look further upstream and reduce the amount of protein solution made in the first place. Cryo-EM needs fewer copies of a protein molecule than x-ray crystallography, and yet purifying techniques haven’t changed significantly in 20 years, he says. Once the Rosalind Franklin Institute opens its doors, he says, its researchers will work on techniques that could supplant chromatographic columns—the tall tubes that separate and purify proteins.</p><p>Sample preparation has a more fundamental problem: The air-water interfaces at the top and bottom of the thin films are perilous for proteins. Drifting proteins that happen to encounter an edge in the moments before flash-freezing—which is likely given the films’ thinness—tend to stick to the surface. “This peels them open and really destroys them,” Russo says.</p><p>Russo and colleagues found a way to protect them, by undergirding the thin film with graphene, a one-atom-thick layer of pure carbon that is transparent to the electron beam. The researchers patterned the graphene with “functional groups”—chemical studs such as carboxyl or amine groups. Those groups jut into the solution and stick to passing proteins, preventing them from wandering into the air-water interface above. “Instead of having two dangerous surfaces, we’re replacing one of them with one we can control,” Russo says.</p><p>Other researchers are trying to wring efficiencies at the back end of the process. New K3 detectors released in 2017 by the company Gatan are not only accurate, but fast. They can vacuum up 6000 pictures in 1 day, several times the rate of a few years ago, Carragher says, allowing more proteins to be tested.</p><p>BUT HENDERSON SAYS the major bottleneck is the cost of the machines, which keeps them scarce.</p><p>A lack of competition helps explain the cost. Hitachi and JEOL make cryo-EM microscopes, but they have not put a dent in Thermo Fisher’s commanding market share. Gatan has a similar hold on the market for detectors, which are sometimes sold separately from the microscopes at roughly $1 million a pop.</p><p>The monopolistic pressures nearly got worse. In June 2018, Thermo Fisher made a $925 million bid to buy Gatan and form a cryo-EM superpower. But in April 2019, the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority found that such a merger would reduce competition and lead to even higher prices. By June 2019, Thermo Fisher had scrapped the deal. “We need competition,” Carragher says. “Unless somebody’s chasing you, why would you innovate?”</p><p>Steve Reyntjens, Thermo Fisher’s director of product marketing for cryo-EM, says the company is not resting on its laurels. Scientists’ productivity per Krios has risen as the company has improved the microscope’s detectors and data collection software, he says. “We have a track record of innovating.”</p><p>And a Krios is expensive for legitimate reasons, including the gear that accelerates electrons to energies of 300 kiloelectronvolts (keV). Operating at voltages of 300 kilovolts, more than 2500 times stronger than electricity from a U.S. wall socket, the machine requires a bulky transformer and thick, heavily insulated cabling. Massive, costly magnets are needed to focus the high-energy electrons into beams. “Everything needs to be tightly controlled and minutely aligned,” Reyntjens says.</p><p>The high energies also require expensive safety measures. As the powerful electric fields accelerate the electrons, arcs—little lightning bolts—can form. To prevent arcing, the field emission guns that produce the electrons are suffused in sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas, which snuffs out sparks. But the gas destroys ozone, makes toxic byproducts, and must be recycled. X-rays generated when stray 300-keV electrons hit metal are another hazard, requiring several centimeters of lead shielding around the microscope.</p><p>Krios machines are too tall for the average ceiling heights in most countries, and labs have to build special footings to handle the load, between 1000 and 2000 kilograms. López says OHSU spent $20 million to renovate space for its new microscopes.</p><p>Yet researchers widely believe the high energies are indispensable. The goal is to send electrons close enough to atomic nuclei in a protein to feel an attractive electrostatic force. Their paths are bent, or scattered elastically—meaning they lose no energy. The pattern of those elastically scattered electrons can be used to build up a picture.</p><p>Low-energy electrons are prone to getting too close. They collide either with the nucleus or, more often, with one of the protein’s many electrons, scattering inelastically. That causes two problems: The electrons deposit energy into the specimen, eventually destroying it, and they ricochet at lower speeds and odd angles that don’t contribute to a picture. At high energies, electrons zip through faster, with less time to “feel” the electrostatic forces, resulting in fewer of the good elastic scattering events.</p><p>In a trade-off between gathering information and avoiding specimen damage, 300 keV is seen as cryo-EM’s sweet spot. But no one had actually tested that assumption. “Amazing, huh?” Russo muses.</p><p>When Henderson, Russo, and a colleague did so, they found a surprise: At 100 keV, they did indeed get more bad events, but also many more good ones—enough to make the trade-off worthwhile. For thin specimens, Henderson says, 100-keV microscopes should actually be better.</p><p>To prove the point, the LMB team cobbled together a 100-keV machine from spare parts and, in October 2019, published results in the crystallography journal IUCrJ showing they could resolve atoms on five well-known proteins. Such a microscope doesn’t need thick lead shielding or an expensive SF6 system, and the scope can be much smaller and lighter. “It’s actually a huge difference,” Naismith says.</p><p>The team hopes now to entice a company to build a 100-keV machine. At an August 2019 microscopy meeting in Portland, Oregon, Henderson and Russo met privately with Thermo Fisher’s CEO and officials from other manufacturers to coax them into making something new and selling it for less. “They listen politely,” Henderson says, but so far “we’re on our own.”</p><p>Reyntjens points to Glacios, a 200-keV cryo-EM microscope that Thermo Fisher sells for half as much as a Krios, and says, “Our long-term strategy is to support the democratization of cryo-EM.”</p><p>Henderson set about finding smaller companies to take up the 100-keV mantle. He persuaded a U.K. company, York Probe Sources, to build a cheap field emission gun. “I started from a clean slate and designed it for 100 kilovolts,” says founder and electronics engineer Mohamed El Gomati.</p><p>Henderson also enlisted the help of Swiss company Dectris, which says it can build detectors for less than £150,000. Sacha De Carlo, Dectris’s EM business development manager, expects the campaign by Henderson and colleagues will create demand for 100-keV detectors. “He’s extremely influential,” De Carlo says.</p><p>And next month, JEOL will deliver to LMB the first of three cheap 100-keV microscopes—a basic model to which Henderson plans to add the field emission gun and detector.</p><p>If he can wow fellow scientists with good results—and show that the price tag is well under $1 million—he’s confident that Thermo Fisher will snap to attention. “Either through shame or blackmail or bribery, we’ll get them to do it in the end,” Henderson jokes.</p><p>Henderson already knows where he will put 100-keV machines. At LMB, he has been given space in a room formerly devoted to x-ray crystallography—a metaphor not lost on him. The small cryo-EM machines will fit easily in the room, with no need for renovations. One of the in-house x-ray sources has already been cleared away. A few technicians work on a declining library of crystals while Henderson squints to visualize the tools he’s trying to muscle into existence. “X-rays are on their way out, really,” he says. Cryo-EM—cheap cryo-EM—is on its way in.</p><p>*Correction, 23 January, 12:45 p.m.: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Richard Henderson was LMB’s most recent Nobel laureate.</p>\",\"date\":\"Jan. 23, 2020\",\"link\":\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/we-need-people-s-cryo-em-scientists-hope-bring-revolutionary-microscope-masses\",\"discrp\":\"\\n      ‘We need a people’s cryo-EM.’ Scientists hope to bring revolutionary microscope to the masses      \\n  \\n      Cheap cryo–electron microscope could accelerate discovery of protein structures  \\n\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","{\"content\":\"<p>The microbes in our guts have been linked to everything from arthritis to autism. Now, scientists say they can even tell us about our future health. Two new studies find that our “microbiome”—the mix of microbes in our gut—can reveal the presence of many diseases better than our own genes can—and can even anticipate our risk of dying within the next 15 years.</p><p>“I am hopeful and enthusiastic that the community will reach a point where we’re able to develop microbiome-based therapeutics and diagnostics,” says Samuel Minot, a microbiome researcher at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who was not involved in the research. “I think that this is within the realm of possibility.”</p><p>In the first study, researchers reviewed 47 studies looking at associations between the collective genomes of the gut microbes and 13 common diseases. These included schizophrenia, hypertension, and asthma—all of which are considered “complex” because they are caused by both environmental and genetic factors. They then compared these studies with 24 genome-wide association (GWA) studies, which correlate specific human genetic variants with diseases.\\n</p><p>Overall, the genetic signature of gut microbes was 20% better at discriminating between a healthy and an ill person than a person’s own genes, the team reports in a paper posted this month on the preprint server bioRxiv. The microbiome was 50% better than GWA studies at predicting whether someone had colorectal cancer. A person’s own genetic profile only outperformed the microbiome for predicting whether someone had type 1 diabetes.</p><p>Though study author Braden Tierney, a computational biologist at Harvard Medical School, admits the analysis is preliminary, he says the work could ultimately benefit people. “We can use both the microbiome and human genetics in the clinic to improve patient quality of life.” The goal, he says, is to identify key markers in both sets of genomes that could help diagnose these complex diseases.</p><p>Still, microbiome researcher Jeroen Raes of the VIB-KU Leuven Center for Microbiology, says scientists don’t know nearly as much about the microbiome as they do about how our genes work. So comparing the two at this point is “risky.”</p><p>One advantage of the microbiome, however, he says, is that it’s impacted by a person’s environment: what they eat and how much they exercise, for example. As such, it may be a better predictor of diseases like type 2 diabetes, which tend to have large environmental components.</p><p>In the second study, researchers looked at the link between a person’s microbiome and their life span. The analysis took advantage of a Finnish study that has been collecting health data from thousands of participants since 1972. In 2002, participants donated stool samples that were sequenced 15 years later. The data reveal that individuals with an abundance of Enterobacteriaceae bacteria—a family of potentially infectious bacteria that includes Escherichia coli and salmonella—are 15% more likely to die in the next 15 years the team reports this month on the preprint server medRxiv.</p><p>The link between the gut bacteria and increased risk of death held across the eastern and western Finnish populations, which have different genetic backgrounds and lifestyles.</p><p>Minot says he’s impressed with the study because such long-term analyses are rare and hard to replicate. “I’d love to see more of them in the future.”</p><p>For both studies, it’s still unclear why the microbiome is linked to death and disease. It’s possible the microbes are causing disease or shortening someone’s life span in some way. But it’s also possible they’re just reflecting whatever else is going on in the body.</p><p>Either way, doctors and scientists that want to help prevent and treat human disease should be paying a lot more attention to the tiny residents in our guts, Tierney says.</p>\",\"date\":\"Jan. 23, 2020\",\"link\":\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/microbes-your-gut-could-predict-whether-you-re-likely-die-next-15-years\",\"discrp\":\"\\n      The microbes in your gut could predict whether you’re likely to die in the next 15 years      \\n  \\n      Two studies find strong predictive power of microbiome in complex diseases and death  \\n\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","{\"content\":\"<p>Despite international bans, some countries, such as Syria, use deadly nerve agents against enemy soldiers and civilians. Existing treatments for these chemical weapon attacks must be given quickly and don’t always prevent convulsions or brain damage. Now, U.S. Army researchers have created a gene therapy that allows mice to make their own nerve agent–busting proteins, providing protection against the toxicants for months.</p><p>The strategy could theoretically be adopted for human soldiers, but it would have risks. A person could develop a harmful immune response to the introduced protein, for example. “There are a number of pros and cons,” says biochemist Moshe Goldsmith of the Weizmann Institute of Science, who was not involved with the research.</p><p>Nerve agents are chemicals known as organophosphates. The most commonly used type includes sarin, soman, cyclosarin, and tabun. All block an enzyme that regulates levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in muscles, causing muscle spasms, difficulty breathing, and sometimes death. Current treatments, such as atropine and diazepam, work by blocking acetylcholine receptors, but they must be administered right away and can’t always prevent permanent neurological damage.\\n</p><p>Seeking a better solution, some researchers have injected lab animals with sped-up versions of human enzymes that spur organophosphates to break down before they can cause damage. For example, Goldsmith and collaborators have tweaked an enzyme called paraoxonase 1 (PON1) so that it can help the body defang nerve agents faster. But the Army would need to produce and store large quantities of such “bioscavengers” for injection into soldiers and might need to find a way to shield the proteins from the immune system for them to be effective.</p><p>So scientists at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense took a different approach: Turn the liver into a factory for making a bioscavenger enzyme. Led by biochemist Nageswararao Chilukuri, they used a harmless virus called an adeno-associated virus to ferry DNA instructions into the liver cells of mice. The result was the mice’s liver cells cranking out a potent version of PON1.</p><p>Mice injected with the DNA-ferrying virus soon had high blood levels of the synthetic PON1 enzyme, which remained stable for the 5-month study. The rodents survived nine normally lethal injections of nerve agents over 6 weeks, the Army team reports today in Science Translational Medicine.</p><p>“We were surprised by how well this protein is expressed and how long it lasted,” Chilukuri says. The team also showed the PON1 levels were just as high when the treatment was injected into muscles, a more practical delivery method on the battlefield.</p><p>The gene therapy seemed to cause no harm to the mice. And although the animals made antibodies against the foreign PON1 protein, indicating an immune response, the antibody levels were too low to mute the protein’s activity against nerve agents. Chilukuri’ s team suggests the therapy could protect soldiers, first responder medical staff, and military dogs, and could also protect farm workers at risk of being exposed to organophosphate pesticides. These are less toxic than nerve agents but can cause similar health effects at high doses.</p><p>“It’s a very nice paper, a nice advance in the field,” says biochemist Oksana Lockridge of the University of Nebraska Medical Center. But she and others caution that the revved-up PON1—which contains parts of the rabbit, rodent, and human versions of PON1—is likely to provoke a stronger immune response in people, which could dull its effectiveness or cause severe health effects. People receiving the therapy might even make antibodies against standard human PON1, which the body uses to process harmful cholesterol, and could end up with an elevated risk of heart disease, Goldsmith says.</p><p>Chilukuri acknowledges the caveats but notes his team didn’t set out to solve all possible problems with the therapy. “It’s kind of a proof of principle study,” he says. “This is one way to keep the bioscavenger working for weeks and months in an animal.”</p><p>*Correction, 23 January, 10:55 a.m.: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that doctors would need to inject large quantities of “bioscavenger” drugs into the bloodstream and misstated Oksana Lockridge's affiliation. </p>\",\"date\":\"Jan. 23, 2020\",\"link\":\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/genetic-modification-could-protect-soldiers-chemical-weapons\",\"discrp\":\"\\n      Genetic modification could protect soldiers from chemical weapons      \\n  \\n      Gene therapy tested in mice turns liver into shield against deadly nerve agents  \\n\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}"]
