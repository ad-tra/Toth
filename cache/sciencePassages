Mice given the substance—alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG)—were healthier as they aged, and females lived longer than mice not on the supplement.</p><p>Other compounds, like the antiaging drug rapamycin and the diabetes treatment metformin, have shown similar effects in mouse experiments. But AKG is naturally made by mice and by our own bodies, and it is already considered safe to consume by regulators.</p><p>“The big thing about this is that its safety profile is so good,” says University of North Dakota aging researcher Holly Brown-Borg, who was not involved with the study. “It has potential and should be explored further, for sure.”</p><p>AKG is part of the metabolic cycle that our cells use to make energy from food. In addition to its use by bodybuilders, doctors sometimes treat osteoporosis and kidney disease with the supplement.</p><p>The molecule grabbed attention as a possible antiaging treatment in 2014, when researchers reported AKG could extend life span by more than 50% in tiny Caenorhabditis elegans worms. That’s on par with a low-calorie diet, which has been shown to promote healthy aging, but is hard for most people to stick with. Other groups later showed life span improvements from AKG in fruit flies.</p><p>In the new study, Gordon Lithgow and Brian Kennedy of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and colleagues turned to mammals. They gave groups of 18-month-old mice (about age 55 in human years) the equivalent of 2% of their daily chow as AKG until they died, or for up to 21 months. AKG levels in blood gradually drop with age, and the scientists’ aim was to restore levels to those seen in young animals.</p><p>Some differences jumped out within a few months: “They looked much blacker, shinier, and younger” than control mice, says Azar Asadi Shahmirzadi, a postdoc at the Buck Institute who did the experiments as a graduate student. In addition, the AKG-fed mice scored an average of more than 40% better on tests of “frailty,” as measured by 31 physiological attributes including hair color, hearing, walking gait, and grip strength. And female mice lived a median of 8% to 20% longer after AKG treatment began than control mice, the group reports today in Cell Metabolism.</p><p>The AKG-eating mice did not perform better on tests of heart function or treadmill endurance, however, and the tests did not include cognitive performance.</p><p>Probing the mechanism for these improvements, the researchers found that female mice receiving AKG produced higher levels of a molecule that tamps down on inflammation. Chronic inflammation can spur many diseases of aging such as cancer, heart disease, arthritis, and dementia.</p><p>The effects on life span and health were smaller for AKG than for some other antiaging compounds, notes aging researcher Matt Kaeberlein of the University of Washington, Seattle, who was not involved with the work. But some of those compounds have run into safety issues—for example, rapamycin suppresses the immune system and may promote diabetes.</p><p>Kennedy, now also at the National University of Singapore, plans to test AKG in human volunteers soon. Looking at a group of people between the ages of 45 and 65, his group will see whether the molecule improves aging-related biomarkers such as inflammation, arterial hardening, and a type of chemical signature on DNA associated with aging. The company Ponce de Leon Health, where Kennedy serves as chief scientific officer (and Gordon and other paper authors have stock), is running a similar study at Indiana University.</p><p>Ponce de Leon Health already sells a formulation of AKG called Rejuvant that it says can “slow the aging process.” Kennedy defends these claims. “We are upfront about the data that we have and do not yet have on the website,” he says. And Brown-Borg notes the Buck Institute team isn’t the first group of aging-focused researchers to start a company to develop an antiaging treatment, an idea she hopes will eventually pan out in clinical trials. “It’s an exciting time in the field,” she says.</p><p>© 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

A new study suggests single-celled organisms—and even individual cancer cells—are just as adept, using chemical signals to find their way through complex mazes hundreds of times their size.</p><p>Individual cells, whether cancer cells, skin cells, or single-celled organisms like bacteria, generally know where to go by sensing attractive chemicals in their environments and moving toward them, a process called chemotaxis. This basic type of navigation works best for short distances, generally less than half a millimeter. But when cells traverse longer, more complex paths, they can’t just passively follow a chemical gradient: They need to process the chemicals around them in real time to pick the best way forward.</p><p>To figure out how cells do this, researchers tested two known for going the distance—a soil-dwelling amoeba (Dictyostelium discoideum) and mouse pancreatic cancer cells. The researchers designed microscopic mazes with a pool of attractant chemicals at the end; they also filled the maze with the same chemicals so cells could build their own chemical trails. The miniature labyrinths had plenty of twists and turns—a perfect proxy for the complex path through soil or to a blood vessel.</p><p>Both cell types successfully maneuvered through the mazes, the researchers report today in Science, making it through various 0.85-millimeter-long mazes. The faster moving amoebas then tackled a longer one designed to mimic the famous Hampton Court Palace hedge maze outside of London (see video). Because the cancer cells moved so slowly, they likely would have perished during the longer journey.</p><p>By breaking down the chemicals as they moved through the maze, the first wave of amoeba cells was able to distinguish between the maze’s dead ends—which had limited amounts of the attractive chemical—and the correct path forward. But subsequent waves of cells weren’t so lucky. In nature, leading cells give off signals to their trailing counterparts to follow them. In the experiment, scientists modified cells to make such communication impossible. After the pioneers broke down the chemicals—essentially clearing them from the path—the stragglers were left unsure of where to go next. </p><p>© 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

When brought back to the lab and fed, they started to multiply. The microbes are oxygen-loving species that somehow exist on what little of the gas diffuses from the ocean surface deep into the seabed.</p><p>The discovery raises the “insane” possibility, as one of the scientists put it, that the microbes have been sitting in the sediment dormant, or at least slowly growing without dividing, for eons.</p><p>The new work demonstrates “microbial life is very persistent, and often finds a way to survive,” says Virginia Edgcomb, a microbial ecologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who was not involved in the work.</p><p>What’s more, by showing that life can survive in places biologists once thought uninhabitable, the research speaks to the possibility of life elsewhere in the Solar System, or elsewhere in the universe. “If the surface of a particular planet does not look promising for life, it may be holding out in the subsurface,” says Andreas Teske, a microbiologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who was also not involved with the new study.</p><p>Researchers have known that life exists “under the floorboards” of the ocean for more than 15 years. But geomicrobiologist Yuki Morono of the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology wanted to know the limits of such life. Microbes are known to live in very hot or toxic environments, but can they live where there’s little food to eat?</p><p>To find out, Morono and his colleagues mounted a drilling expedition in the South Pacific Gyre, a site of intersecting ocean currents east of Australia that is considered the deadest part of the world’s oceans, almost completely lacking the nutrients needed for survival. When they extracted cores of clay and other sediments from as deep as 5700 meters below sea level, they confirmed the samples did indeed contain some oxygen, a sign that there was very little organic material for bacteria to eat.</p><p>To explore what life might be there, Morono’s team carefully extracted small clay samples from the centers of the drilled cores, put them in glass vials, and added simple compounds, such as acetate and ammonium, that contained heavier forms—or isotopes—of nitrogen and carbon that could be detected in living microbes. On the day when the group first “fed” the mud samples with these compounds, and up to 557 days later, the team extracted bits of clay from the samples and dissolved it to spot any living microbes—despite the lack of food for them in the clay.</p><p>The work was challenging. Typically, there are at least 100,000 cells per cubic centimeter of seafloor mud. But in these samples, there were no more than 1000 bacteria in the same amount of sediment. So, the biologists had to develop specialized techniques such as using chemical tracers to detect whether any contaminating seawater got into the samples and developing a way to analyze very small amounts of cells and isotopes. “The preparation and care needed to do this work was really impressive,” says Kenneth Nealson, an environmental microbiologist retired from the University of Southern California.</p><p>The added nutrients woke up a variety of oxygen-using bacteria. In samples from the 101.5-million-year-old layer, the microbes increased by four orders of magnitude to more than 1 million cells per cubic centimeter after 65 days, the team reports today in Nature Communications.</p><p>Others have found bacteria in oxygenated sediments under the sea floor. Last year, William Orsi, a geobiologist at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich described living bacteria from 15-million-year-old sediments, a previous record. “But this study pushes it back by another order of magnitude in terms of geological time,” Orsi notes.</p><p>Genetic analysis of the microbes revealed they belonged to more than eight known bacterial groups, many of which are commonly found elsewhere in saltwater where they play important roles in breaking down organic matter. “It suggests that learning to survive under conditions of extreme energy limitation is a widespread ability,” Nealson says, one that may have evolved early, when there was not much for microbes to feed on. “It may have been a very handy survival trick.”</p><p>The researchers don’t know what the gyre microbes have been doing all these millions of years. Most of the species they found do not form spores, which are an inactive life stage that some bacteria form in unfavorable conditions. It could be the bacteria have been dividing very slowly all this time, which would make those isolated in this study the distant descendants of ancestors millions of years old.</p><p>But there’s so little food in the deep-sea sediments that any microbes there could most likely do little more than repair any damaged molecules. “If they are not dividing at all, they are living for 100 million years, but that seems insane,” says Steve D’Hondt, an oceanographer at the University of Rhode Island, Bay Campus, and co-author of the study. He wonders whether there’s another unrecognized source of energy—perhaps radioactivity—down there that allows slow division by the bacteria, which likely got trapped in these sediments as they were buried by other settling sediments.</p><p>But the bottom line, says Bo Barker Jørgensen, a marine microbiologist at Aarhus University who was not involved with the work, is “low food and energy seem not to set the ultimate limit for life on Earth.”</p><p> I also wish to receive emails from AAAS/Science and Science advertisers, including information on  products, services, and special offers which may include but are not limited to news, career information, & upcoming events.</p><p>© 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

All of those pathogens follow the same well-trodden pathway to break into our cells: They manipulate sugar molecules called sialic acids. Hundreds of millions of these sugars stud the outer surface of every cell in the human body—and the sialic acids in humans are different from those in apes.</p><p>Varki and an international team of researchers have now traced how evolution may have scrambled to construct new defenses after that molecular vulnerability emerged in our distant ancestors. By analyzing modern human genomes and ancient DNA from our extinct cousins, the Neanderthals and Denisovans, the researchers detected a burst of evolution in our immune cells that occurred in an ancestor of all three types of human by at least 600,000 years ago.</p><p>As the researchers report in the current issue of Genome Biology and Evolution, these genetic changes may have sharpened the body’s defenses against the pathogens that evolved to exploit sialic acids—but created new vulnerabilities. In an added irony, they note, humans’ distinctive sialic acids were themselves once a defense against disease. The evolutionary saga is a vivid illustration of the competition between humans and microbes, says microbiologist Christine Szymanski of the University of Georgia, Athens, who is not a co-author. “This gives us a human perspective on how we have to keep changing to keep pace.</p><p>The arena for this evolutionary arms race is the glycocalyx, a sugar coating that protects the outer membrane of all cells. It consists of a forest of molecules that sprout from the cell membrane. The sialic acids are at the tip of the tallest branches, sugar chains called glycans, which are rooted to fats and proteins deeper in the membrane.</p><p>Given their prominence and sheer number, sialic acids are usually the first molecules that invading pathogens encounter. Human cells are coated with one type of sialic acid, N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). But apes and most other mammals also carry a different one, N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc).</p><p>More than 2 million years ago, according to multiple molecular clock methods that estimate when mutations arose, a mutation in a gene on chromosome six made it impossible for human ancestors to make Neu5Gc anymore; instead, they made more of another sialic acid, Neu5Ac. “We now know we had an ancient complete makeover of the surface of the human cells,” says evolutionary biologist Pascal Gagneux of UCSD, a co-author of the new paper. Birds, some bats, ferrets, and New World monkeys all separately made the same evolutionary change.</p><p>The change likely evolved as a defense against malaria, says UCSD physician-scientist Ajit Varki, senior author of the paper and Nissi Varki’s spouse. Malarial parasites that infect chimpanzees were no longer able to bind with the altered sialic acids on our red blood cells.  </p><p>But in the next million years or so, that mutation became a liability, as Neu5Ac became a favorite portal for a flurry of other pathogens. At the infectious disease symposium organized by UCSD’s Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny, researchers described how multiple diseases evolved to use Neu5Ac to enter cells or to evade immune cells.</p><p>Some pathogens use sialic acids, which sit on the outer edge of the cell membrane, to invade a cell. Pathogens sometimes coat themselves in humanlike sialic acids to trick signaling molecules called sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins (Siglecs) into inhibiting immune responses. But other Siglecs can instead turn on an immune response if they sense sialic acids on pathogens.</p><p>Coronaviruses appear to be no exception. “Most coronaviruses infect cells in two steps—first by recognizing abundant sialic acids as binding sites to gain a foothold, and then seeking out the higher affinity protein receptors like ACE2,” Ajit Varki says. “Think of it like an initial handshake or introduction that is required before one can ask for a date.” Two preprints suggest the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, also docks with sialic acids before binding with the ACE2 receptor to pierce human cells.</p><p>In past studies, Ajit Varki and Gagneux suggested the makeover of the cell and the loss of Neu5Gc may have even contributed to the origin of a new species in our genus Homo. If a woman with only Neu5Ac sialic acids mated with a man who still expressed Neu5Gc, her immune system may have rejected that man’s sperm or the fetus that developed from it. This fertility barrier might have helped divide Homo populations into different species more than 2 million years ago, the researchers speculated.</p><p>But the sialic acid change also sparked a new arms race between pathogens and our ancestors. In the new study, the researchers scanned DNA for immune genes in six Neanderthals, two Denisovans, and 1000 humans, and looked at dozens of chimps, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans as well. They found evolutionary changes that “markedly altered” one class of proteins—sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins, or Siglecs—that usually sit on the surface of human immune cells and recognize sialic acids.</p><p>Siglecs are molecular sentries: They probe sialic acids to see whether they are familiar parts of our own bodies or foreign invaders. If Siglecs spot sialic acids that are damaged or missing, they signal immune cells to activate, rousing an inflammatory army to attack potential invaders or clean up dam-aged cells. If sialic acids instead appear to be normal parts of our own cells, other, inhibitory Siglecs throttle back immune defenses so as not to attack our own tissues (see graphic, below).</p><p>The researchers identified functional changes in the DNA of eight out of 13 Siglecs encoded by genes on chromosome 19 in humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans. This hot spot of evolution appears only in Siglec gene variants, not in nearby genes on the chromosome, suggesting natural selection favored these changes, presumably because they helped fight pathogens that target Neu5Ac.</p><p>Apes did not show these changes, says first author Naazneen Khan, an evolutionary biologist now at the University of Kentucky. Given the mutations’ presence in archaic hominins, this burst of evolution must have happened before our lineages diverged 600,000 years ago, but after the mutation in that altered sialic acid arose more than 2 million years ago, perhaps in Homo erectus, thought to be an ancestor of modern humans and Neanderthals.</p><p>Most Siglecs are found on immune cells, but in the new paper, the team reports that several of the human Siglecs that underwent evolutionary changes are expressed in other types of human cells, including some in the placenta, cervix, pancreas, gut, and brain. Siglec changes may have been a side effect of intense battles with pathogens that infected these tissues, Nissi Varki suggests.</p><p>Although the recently mutated Siglecs protect us from pathogens, they may also contribute to other diseases. Some of the genetically changed Siglecs are associated with inflammation and autoimmune disorders such as asthma and with meningitis. The researchers suggest the altered Siglecs are constantly on high alert and do not dampen immune responses against our own tissues; they may even  make some individuals more prone to the runaway inflammation seen in severe COVID-19.</p><p>Other researchers say the work underscores broad evolutionary principles. “This nicely shows that … natural selection is not always going for the optimal solution, because the optimal solution is changing all the time,” says Rita Gerardy-Schahn, a glycobiologist at Hannover Medical School in Germany, who was not part of the new work. “What is best for natural selection in the short run may be the wrong selection tomorrow.”</p><p> I also wish to receive emails from AAAS/Science and Science advertisers, including information on  products, services, and special offers which may include but are not limited to news, career information, & upcoming events.</p><p>© 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Textbooks speak of four DNA building blocks, whose order specifies genes. But researchers in the field of epigenetics have also identified four chemically modified versions of these nucleotide bases, which affect how genes are expressed. Three of them are altered versions of cytosine, one of the original four bases. The last, methylated adenine, is mired in controversy about whether it exists in mammals.</p><p>Now, researchers at Yale University have not only identified plenty of this modified base in mouse embryonic cells, but also found it plays a key role in the development of the placenta. The methylated base—methyladenine for short—gives cells another epigenetic tool for turning genes on or off during normal development or in disease. “This is a very important study for our understanding of the role of [methylated adenine] in gene regulation,” says Peng Jin, a geneticist at Emory University who was not part of the work.</p><p>Animal cells often add methyl or other chemical groups to a cytosine to help switch a gene on or off, whereas bacteria rely heavily on methylation of adenines. But in the past 5 years, researchers have also detected methyladenines in fruit flies, nematode worms, and frogs. Hints of the modified base also turned up in mammals. “If [they] exist, it’s an exciting new layer of biology,” says Eric Greer, an epigeneticist at Harvard University.</p><p>But the reported levels were minuscule, and Greer and others found that many “detections” were the result of bacterial DNA contaminating samples, equipment, and even commercially available enzymes used in experiments. “It’s difficult to rule out contamination by bacterial DNAs,” agrees molecular biologist Ying Liu of Peking University, who has studied methyladenine in nematodes.</p><p>In addition, an antibody sequencing technique that the new study and others have used is often not specific enough to isolate these bases, picking up methylated adenines in RNA as well as in DNA. “The reality is, the techniques we have are not robust enough,” says Colm Nestor, a molecular geneticist at Linköping University.</p><p>But Yale epigeneticist Andrew Xiao persisted. In 2018, his team found methyladenine in high amounts in human glioblastoma cells, where it seemed to affect the growth of this brain cancer. The researchers showed that when they inhibited a protein that removes adenine’s methyl groups, causing methyladenine to accumulate, tumor growth slowed.</p><p>In mice, methyladenine stabilizes unwound DNA by preventing binding by the SATB1 protein. Methyladenine’s actions enable stem cells to multiply before differentiating to form the placenta.</p><p>Earlier this month in Nature, Xiao, epigeneticist Haitao Li at Tsinghua University, and their colleagues reported that they have found the modified base in normal mouse cells: the trophoblast stem cells, which eventually give rise to the placenta. The methyladenines are prevalent at places in DNA called M/SAR regions, which help create temporary “compartments” dividing active and inactive regions of the genome. As these compartments form, DNA’s double helix unwinds briefly.</p><p>Using the antibody sequencing methods and taking precautions to avoid the known specificity issues with methyladenine, Xiao and his colleagues discovered that methyladenines in unwound DNA prevent the binding of the SATB1 protein needed to rewind the DNA. The unwinding in turn blocks the expression of genes that would make trophoblast stem cells differentiate and stop growing. Instead, the cells multiply, ensuring there are enough of them to make the full placenta. Later, the methyls are removed—the researchers don’t know how—and the cells start specializing to make the placenta.</p><p>The same process may govern placental development in humans—and disrupt embryonic growth and development when it goes awry—says Indira Mysorekar, a reproductive biologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. “The paper is exciting.”</p><p>Researchers pursuing methyladenine also see it as vindication. “It provides one of the best supports so far of [the importance of methyladenine] in a mammalian system,” says Chuan He, a biochemist at the University of Chicago. In the May issue of Molecular Cell, his group reported that methyladenine increases more than 1000-fold in mammalian mitochondrial DNA when cells are starved of oxygen—an earlier hint that it plays a biological role.</p><p>Nestor admires Xiao’s careful experiments, but stresses that “the devil is in the details.” Methyladenine, he says, “could be one of the epigenetic discoveries of the last few decades, or it could be just a cautionary tale,” about researchers being too hopeful when contamination and imprecise methods prevail.</p><p>But even if the discovery is confirmed, Peng says he is leery of calling the modified adenine an addition to the genetic code. “Maybe [part] of the ‘epigenetic code’ instead?”</p><p> I also wish to receive emails from AAAS/Science and Science advertisers, including information on  products, services, and special offers which may include but are not limited to news, career information, & upcoming events.</p><p>© 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The event was a bit different this year, of course, because of the coronavirus pandemic. Only 10 people competed, and there was no live audience. But Joey “Jaws” Chestnut still managed to set a world record, scarfing down 75 hot dogs (buns included) in 10 minutes.</p><p>Surprisingly—and perhaps a bit horrifyingly—he could have eaten a few more. In a new study, a researcher calculates that a human could theoretically devour 83 hot dogs in 10 minutes—a rate of consumption similar to that of a grizzly bear chowing down on animal flesh.</p><p>James Smoliga came up with the idea for the study while reading about research on track and field performance. Scientists have tried to estimate human limits for athletic events such as the marathon or 100-yard dash using data from past record holders, says Smoliga, a physiologist at High Point University. While reading a paper on the limits of human running speed, he thought, “I bet the hot dog competition is similar to this.”</p><p>Smoliga turned to a mathematical model created by Mark Denny, a biologist at Stanford University. Denny used the model to estimate the maximum possible running speeds of dogs, horses, and humans. By finding a mathematical function that fits data points from past world records in a certain event (in this case, hot dog eating) over time, Denny says, one can then predict performance limits in that event.</p><p>Thankfully for Smoliga, competitive eating enthusiasts have diligently documented their feats over the years. Combining those self-collected data points with information from the Nathan’s Famous website, he pulled together 39 years of data, ending in 2019. (Though the contest began in 1972, consistent competition times of 10 to 12 minutes began in the early ’80s.)</p><p>The winning number of hot dogs has ballooned, Smoliga found, from 10 in 1980 to a gargantuan 74 in 2018–the previous record, also held by Chestnut. “We haven’t gotten twice as fast in the 100 meters or twice as fast in the marathon over 100 years,” Smoliga says. “It doesn’t compare to anything else that we’ve seen in sports.”</p><p>These skyrocketing numbers are likely due to competitors stepping up their training, he says, by practicing downing large amounts of food or water in a limited time. The goal is to train the stomach to relax and rapidly stretch, allowing these professional eaters to “take in this enormous volume that most people can’t,” says David Metz, a gastroenterologist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.</p><p>In 2007, Metz documented this impressive (or appalling) stomach expansion in a competitive eater. In one test, a competitive eater guzzled 4.5 liters of water in just 2 minutes, whereas a person with no competitive eating experience drank less than 2 liters.</p><p>While shaving off one-tenth of a second in the 100-meter dash depends on complex processes in the cardiovascular, muscular, and skeletal systems, stretching one’s stomach is simpler, Smoliga says. (He compares it to using progressively larger earrings to slowly expand earlobes, though the stomach can more easily contract back to its normal size.) That could explain the rapid increase in winning hot dog counts in a relatively short time.</p><p>And there’s still room for improvement, Smoliga found. According to his calculations, a human being should be able to swallow up to 83 hot dogs in 10 minutes, he reports today in Biology Letters.</p><p>Denny cautions, however, that math alone isn’t enough because equations do not account for physiological factors. In particular, Metz adds, research is slim on the physiology of competitive eaters, so there are still many unknowns, including the maximum capacity of the human stomach.</p><p>And he cautions the public not to try to find out for themselves. An amateur eater could suffer serious health consequences trying to ingest a humongous volume, he warns, potentially choking or rupturing their stomach. Simply put, he says, “They shouldn’t try this at home.”</p><p> I also wish to receive emails from AAAS/Science and Science advertisers, including information on  products, services, and special offers which may include but are not limited to news, career information, & upcoming events.</p><p>© 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The tool, which worked in lab experiments with human cells, could open the door to new studies of—and one day therapies for—dozens of hard-to-treat diseases caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). These rare conditions, which include Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and lethal infantile cardiomyopathy, collectively affect about one in 4000 people. Until now, research on these illnesses has been stymied in part because there was no way of reproducing the mutations in strains of mice.</p><p>The new DNA editor is “quite innovative and pioneering,” says Joseph Hacia, a medical geneticist at the University of Southern California. “It’s highly likely that it will work in mice, and I’m hopeful that it will have therapeutic implications down the line.”</p><p>Thousands of mitochondria, which likely evolved from bacteria, exist in most every human cell, and each contains its own genes. Researchers have made little headway correcting the genetic defects that lead to mitochondrial diseases, many of which are caused by “point mutations.” In such mutations, a single DNA base—adenine, cytosine, thymine, or guanine—is replaced by one that disrupts a needed protein or otherwise impairs the power plant. One difficulty is that a key component of the most famous genome editor, CRISPR, is too large to enter mitochondria. And other genome editors that can reach mtDNA do not have the subtlety to correct point mutations.</p><p>To create the new tool, which combines features of CRISPR and an older technology called transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs), three teams joined forces. “Part of what made the project so fun to work on, and ultimately successful, is the fact that three labs came together organically because the science led us to each other,” says David Liu, a chemist at the Broad Institute and the last author of a paper that describes the work in Nature today.</p><p>The first step toward that collaboration was a finding by Marcos de Moraes, a postdoc working in a University of Washington, Seattle, lab run by microbiologist Joseph Mougous. The team studies how bacteria secrete toxins to kill off other bacteria when there are scarce resources. In 2018, de Moraes stumbled on a bacterial toxin that helps catalyze the conversion of cytosine into uracil. (This base is normal in RNA, but in DNA it naturally converts into thymine.) What’s more, the toxin creates this mutation on both strands of the DNA double helix, which had not been seen before.</p><p>Mougous, who like Liu is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator but did not know the scientist, emailed him to ask whether he was interested in collaborating because Liu’s lab previously had developed cytosine and adenine base editors that used a similar catalyzing agent—an enzyme known as a deaminase—combined with two components of CRISPR technology. These deaminases only work on single-stranded DNA. The CRISPR duo includes a strand of RNA that helps untwist the double helix and shuttles the deaminase to precise targets on single strands. But this guide RNA (gRNA) cannot enter mitochondria.</p><p>Mougous says the two groups recognized from the outset that the new base editor had no obvious advantage over the ones Liu’s team had developed. “That pushed us to look for its niche,” he says, which proved to be altering mtDNA. Vamsi Mootha, a Broad Institute specialist in mitochondrial dysfunction and another HHMI investigator, also joined the collaboration. “I’ve been in the field for 25 years, and this is the first time ever that we’ve been able to [manipulate cells], and, voilà, a few days later, you have edits to the mitochondrial DNA.”</p><p>TALE and zinc-finger nucleases, another genome editor that predates CRISPR, can both sever the double-stranded DNA of mitochondria, destroying them. That has the protentional to treat some mitochondrial diseases, but it cannot correct mtDNA point mutations. To make a more refined tool, Beverly Mok, a graduate student in Liu’s lab, attached the toxin-derived deaminase from Mougous’s lab to a TALE, a protein that can enter mitochondria and, like gRNA, leads the complex to the target.</p><p>Because the deaminase is toxic to mitochondria, the researchers split it into two halves that come together only at the mtDNA target. “We had to tame the beast,” Liu says. In experiments with human cells, the conversion of cytosine to thymine occurred up to 50% of the time, the collaboration reports today in Nature. Importantly, they did not find a significant number of “off-target” edits, which potentially can cause serious harm.</p><p>Michio Hirano, who studies mitochondrial diseases at Columbia University and was not involved with the work, says this is a “very clever” strategy that “addresses a holy grail in the mitochondrial field.”</p><p>On top of trying to create cell and mouse models of human mitochondrial diseases, the researchers will look for other bacterial deaminases that can modify double-stranded DNA. They also hope to improve editing efficiency and reduce off-target edits so that mtDNA base editing can eventually be tested in humans. “We recognize that it’s a long road to get there,” Liu says. “I’m hopeful that the energy and the resourcefulness of the field will take these tools and continue to improve them now that we have the blueprints.”</p><p> I also wish to receive emails from AAAS/Science and Science advertisers, including information on  products, services, and special offers which may include but are not limited to news, career information, & upcoming events.</p><p>© 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

But a call in early 1999 changed that.</p><p>“It’s one of the best cold calls I’ve ever made,” says James Elser, a limnologist at the University of Montana. He had picked up the phone to invite Souza Saldívar to join a NASA-funded astrobiology project in Cuatro Ciénegas—a butterfly-shaped basin with colorful pools, or pozas, in the middle of Mexico’s Chihuahuan Desert.</p><p>Neither Souza Saldívar, a microbial ecologist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, University City, nor her ecologist husband and research partner Luis Eguiarte Fruns, also at UNAM, had ever visited Cuatro Ciénegas in the state of Coahuila. That first trip convinced them to completely change their research plans. “Looking at those mountains and the water, I fell in love,” Souza Saldívar says.</p><p>The landscape—more than 300 turquoise-blue pozas scattered across 800 square kilometers, among marshes and majestic mountains—wasn’t the only draw. The waters, whose chemistry resembled that of Earth’s ancient seas, teemed with microbes; unusual bacterial mats and formations called stromatolites carpeted the shallows. When Souza Saldívar first cultured the organisms from the pozas, “The amount of microbes was enormous, as was the diversity of colors and colony sizes,” she recalls. For her, this remote microbial hot spot was an irresistible mystery.</p><p>Since then, work by Souza Saldívar, Eguiarte Fruns, and a widening circle of collaborators in Mexico and the United States has shown that Cuatro Ciénegas—which means “four marshes” in Spanish—is one of the most biodiverse places on the planet. “There’s nowhere that has so much ancient diversity of microorganisms,” says Michael Travisano, an evolutionary ecologist at University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, who has collaborated with the Mexican researchers since 2001. Among the most recent additions to that menagerie are hundreds of species of archaea, the ancient microbes that may have given rise to eukaryotes—organisms with complex, nucleated cells.</p><p>At the Pozas Azules ranch in Cuatro Ciénegas, about 100 spring-fed pools dapple the desert. Each has a unique microbial and mineral composition.</p><p>The diversity includes strains with unusual adaptations, such as the ability to build their lipid membranes with sulfur instead of the usual phosphorus, which is scarce in the waters of the pozas. It includes potential sources of new compounds for medicine and agriculture. And it poses a question that has occupied Souza Saldívar and Eguiarte Fruns for the past 20 years: How did this Noah’s Ark of ancient microbes arise? “It’s a dream for every biologist to know the origin of diversification,” Souza Saldívar says.</p><p>But her dream might be short-lived. Since the 1970s, farmers have intensively drained water from the pozas and rivers to irrigate nearby fields of alfalfa, grown for cattle fodder, gradually drying the improbable oasis. Souza Saldívar has galvanized a conservation effort that has slowed the drainage; in the coming weeks, a canal that removes 100 million cubic meters of Cuatro Ciénegas’s water annually is scheduled to close. In the meantime, the researchers have been trying to describe as much as they can, as fast as they can, before their beloved pozas dry up and the precious microscopic life that has survived undisturbed for millions of years dies off.</p><p>Cuatro Ciénegas served as a stopping point for hunter-gatherers for thousands of years. To date, 50 archaeological sites with cave paintings—some dating to 2275 B.C.E.—have been found in mountain caves around the basin. Much later, the region made a mark on history when Venustiano Carranza, born in a village at the basin’s margin, became a leader of the Mexican Revolution and president of Mexico from 1917 to 1920. Nowadays, the village is called Cuatro Ciénegas de Carranza after him.</p><p>But in the 1960s, Cuatro Ciénegas started to become famous for its biodiversity, as biologists began to describe new species of snails, fish, turtles, and plants found in the pools and marshes—and often nowhere else.</p><p>Wendell “Minck” Minckley, a renowned ichthyologist at Arizona State University (ASU), Tempe, was first lured to Cuatro Ciénegas after learning that the world’s only aquatic box turtle (Terrapene coahuila) lived there. Over the years, Minckley made frequent trips to the pozas, describing their snails and fish (Herichthys minckleyi, a cichlid, bears his name) while making connections with the local people.</p><p>In the Cuatro Ciénegas Basin, ringed with mountains and desert, an aquifer feeds hundreds of pools and marshes. But canals tapping water for agriculture threaten the wetlands and the biodiversity they host.</p><p>Minckley also noticed peculiar, rocky structures in the pools. They were stromatolites, biological structures normally found as fossils dating back as much as 3.5 billion years. Colonies of photosynthesizing bacteria, which boosted early Earth’s oxygen, created the layered formations by depositing carbonates and trapping sediment in ancient, shallow seas. But these stromatolites were alive. Also found in other extreme environments such as Australia’s warm, salty Shark Bay, living stromatolites “are sort of a window into early Earth,” Elser says. The pozas also nurture bacterial mats, a soft form of stromatolites normally found deep in the ocean.</p><p>As early as the 1970s, Minckley realized the pools and their diversity were under threat: Local farmers were carving canals to tap their water. Thanks in part to his lobbying, the Mexican government in 1994 designated an 85,000-hectare protected area. But the drainage continued. “Minckley knew that Cuatro Ciénegas was going to die,” Souza Saldívar says. He thought NASA might be its salvation.</p><p>In 1998, NASA established its Astrobiology Institute, a network of researchers studying life in extreme environments that might resemble conditions on other planets. Minckley saw an ideal astrobiology study site in the waters of the pozas, with their seemingly inhospitable chemistry and living stromatolites. But he was no expert on extreme environments, so he enlisted Elser, who specializes in how water chemistry affects ecosystems and also works at ASU. After they submitted a 1998 proposal to fund the project, however, NASA said they should add experts on microbiology and evolution—and those experts had to be Mexican to help secure permits to obtain samples. Based on colleagues’ suggestions, Elser called Souza Saldívar and Eguiarte Fruns, newly minted professors at UNAM. They joined, and NASA approved the 3-year project.</p><p>Stromatolites, reeflike colonies of carbonate-secreting cyanobacteria, abounded in Precambrian seas—and thrive at Cuatro Ciénegas.</p><p>With two children in tow, the couple met Minckley and Elser at Cuatro Ciénegas. Next to the turquoise-blue waters of La Becerra poza, Minckley told them he believed the ecosystem was a glimpse of deep time. “Do you see these miniature snails in my hand?” Souza Saldívar recalls him saying. “I just scooped them from the springhead, but their direct ancestors were eating sulfur bacteria in hydrothermal vents 220 million years ago in the bottom of the ancient Pacific.”</p><p>Based on the water chemistry—low in phosphorus, iron, and nitrogen—and the presence of living stromatolites, Minckley believed Cuatro Ciénegas re-created the marine conditions found worldwide millions of years ago. He challenged the two researchers to explore its mysteries—and to protect its pozas. “Only you, as Mexicans, can save them from the extinction caused by humans,” Souza Saldívar recalls him saying.</p><p>To inventory the full diversity of microbes at Cuatro Ciénegas and trace their relationships, Souza Saldívar needed to study their DNA. To do so, scientists normally take microbial samples from a site and grow them in a lab. But many bacteria and archaea are difficult to culture, and only a few groups at the time had successfully analyzed DNA isolated directly from the environment. High magnesium levels in the water and “slime” from the microbes made isolating DNA from the pozas especially difficult.</p><p>But Souza Saldívar and her students Ana Escalante and Laura Espinosa Asuar made a start. In 2006, they reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that they had found 38 distinct groups of microbes—four times as many as in a typical salt marsh—corresponding to 10 major lineages of bacteria and one of archaea. Half the bacterial groups were most closely related to marine microbes. Almost 10% of the groups resembled ones that live on hydrothermal vents—fissures deep in the ocean where microbes thrive despite extreme heat and mineral concentrations.</p><p>As Minckley had suspected, Cuatro Ciénegas had somehow preserved ancient marine life forms deep in the desert, more than 500 kilometers from the Gulf of Mexico, at a site where the last seas retreated some 20 million years ago.</p><p>Valeria Souza Saldívar and Luis Eguiarte Fruns (top) have spent 20 years studying biodiversity at Cuatro Ciénegas, where they have found thousands of new species in living structures like a bacterial mat (bottom).</p><p>“The deep time aspect [of Cuatro Ciénegas] is very surprising,” Travisano says. It is a true “lost world,” preserved by the hostile water chemistry, he and the Mexican team argued in a 2018 paper in eLife. Millions of years ago, they proposed, ancient marine ancestors found their way to the place, adapted to the extreme environment, and didn’t change much.</p><p>The pozas themselves are not particularly ancient. The springs that nurture them are fed by deep aquifers in Sierra San Marcos y Pinos, filled with water accumulated during the last ice ages, Eguiarte Fruns says. Now, the water seeps to the surface because of an active fault beneath the basin. It rises through ancient marine sediments, picking up its unusual chemistry along the way. Somehow, the ancient microbes persisted and diversified in a succession of springs that must have appeared and vanished throughout geologic time. As in an ancient clock, Souza Saldívar says, all the original mechanisms are still working together to sustain unusual life.</p><p>To Frederick Cohan, a microbial ecologist at Wesleyan University who is not part of the Cuatro Ciénegas project, the fact that many of the microbes are related to marine species and not species found inland is compelling. “I think it’s saying those organisms are anciently there.”</p><p>When the researchers looked at the stromatolites, they found even more diversity. Samples from one site, Pozas Azules II, yielded more than 58,000 distinct microbial sequences, predominantly from bacteria—not a direct count of species, but an indicator of biodiversity. In the Río Mezquites, a stream that flows through the northern part of the basin and recharges several pools, they identified 30,000 sequences, mostly from cyanobacteria. More than 1000 sequences from Pozas Azules II appeared to be from archaea, the researchers reported in Environmental Microbiology in 2009. The stromatolites also teemed with bacteria-infecting viruses—strains that were unique to each pool and resembled marine viruses.</p><p>Studying the microbes hasn’t been easy. “There are thousands and thousands of new bacteria that we can’t grow in culture,” Souza Saldívar says. They could, however, identify some startling adaptations to the extreme conditions. In one bacterium found only in El Churince, a system of lagoons and pozas on the western part of the basin, researchers sequenced the smallest genome ever found in its genus, Bacillus. The work, led by Gabriela Olmedo Álvarez, a genetic engineer at Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute, Irapuato, also showed that the microbe—B. coahuilensis—could synthesize membrane sulfolipids. This meant that, like some plants and cyanobacteria, it could use sulfur from the environment—instead of phosphorus—to form its cell membranes.</p><p>Shallow, mineral-rich pools and lagoons, with conditions like those in ancient oceans, are hot spots of microbial diversity. Floating mats at Cuatro Ciénegas teem with the primordial microbes known as archaea, leading researchers to call them “archaean domes.”</p><p>“It likely ‘stole’ these genes from a cyanobacterium,” Olmedo Álvarez says, enabling it to cope with scarce phosphorus, a condition thought to have prevailed in Earth’s earliest oceans. The microbe’s small genome may also have helped it thrive, as it required less phosphorus to build its DNA. Olmedo Álvarez thinks the organism may offer a glimpse of the stratagems used by early microbes to adapt to their new environment.</p><p>“We’re just starting to understand the depth of diversity,” says Olmedo Álvarez, who found that B. coahuilensis is itself starting to split into strains with variations in phosphorus metabolism.</p><p>The low phosphorus conditions found in Cuatro Ciénegas not only promoted local adaptations, but also accelerated microbial diversification, Souza Saldívar and Elser argued in a perspective published in 2008 in Nature Reviews Microbiology. Bacteria normally share bits of DNA with their neighbors in a process called horizontal gene transfer, which blurs the divisions between strains. But in Cuatro Ciénegas, the microbes—hungry for phosphorus—essentially consume free DNA rather than incorporating it into their genomes. “They will eat the DNA to get the phosphorus,” Elser says.</p><p>Besides offering insights into evolution, Cuatro Ciénegas’s microbial diversity may hold practical payoffs. “Cuatro Ciénegas is one of the richest places on the planet for genetic resources,” Souza Saldívar says. For example, most modern antibiotics are derived from actinobacteria, which are abundant in the pozas. Susana De la Torre Zavala, a biotechnologist at the Autonomous University of Nuevo León (UANL), University City, is searching for potential antibiotics in a library of 350 actinobacteria from the basin. Her team has also found that an extract from a microalga living in the pools shows anticancer activity.</p><p>Agriculture, too, could benefit, Olmedo Álvarez says. By 2050, the reservoirs of phosphorus that help sustain global harvests could become scarce, and the microbes’ ability to concentrate the element from different sources could hold solutions. “We’re understanding Cuatro Ciénegas, but we’re also understanding basic principles of ecological interactions that have an application in medicine and agriculture,” she says.</p><p>As the scientific story of Cuatro Ciénegas unfolded, its fate has hung in the balance, with Souza Saldívar fighting a long series of battles over its water with local farmers and landowners, dairy companies, and politicians. Her weapons have been her rising scientific profile and a tireless outreach to the public, especially young people.</p><p>Souza Saldívar has drawn fire—during a 2013 microbiology congress, police had to protect her from protesting locals—but she has won a series of victories. In 2007, the daughter of the CEO of LALA, a giant dairy consortium with roots in the state of Coahuila, told her father she wouldn’t speak to him because “he was killing Cuatro Ciénegas,” Souza Saldívar says. The executive promptly scheduled a meeting with the scientist. “You need to change your cows’ diet,” Souza Saldívar says she told him, refusing to accept a courtesy yogurt he offered. “I’ll accept your yogurt when you do so.” He promised not only to stop buying the region’s alfalfa, but also to invest in environmental education projects for local children.</p><p>Two years later, she won an unusual ally, the powerful Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim. His foundation collaborated with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to buy the land surrounding El Churince in the western basin, and to provide researchers with a 5-year, 18 million Mexican peso ($1.4 million) grant to study Souza Saldívar’s favorite poza. This allowed them to set up the infrastructure to perform long-term experiments. But it did not save the water.</p><p>Endemic fishes and turtles first drew scientists to Cuatro Ciénegas, where they stumbled on its less visible microbial riches.</p><p>In 2010, Mexico’s National Water Commission (CONAGUA) set out to replace the open, leaky canals, which lose 75% of the drained water, with less wasteful enclosed conduits. But the project was abandoned midway—most likely because of corruption—and the old canals were never closed. As Cuatro Ciénegas continued to dry up, the researchers raced to study El Churince, finding 5167 distinct species of bacteria and archaea in the last remaining pool. A close inspection of the genomes of Bacillus bacteria from one single square kilometer increased the known diversity of the group by more than 20%. By comparing DNA sequences, the team traced the Bacillus diversity to two ancient ancestors, one dating back 680 million years, the other 160 million years. Those dates coincide with the breakup of the supercontinents Rodinia and Pangaea, respectively, and the team thinks the oceans that formed during those convulsions carried the ancestral microbes to what is now the Cuatro Ciénegas Basin, where they have persisted ever since.</p><p>Cohan says that’s plausible. Bacillus from elsewhere fail to thrive in Cuatro Ciénegas, most likely because they are outcompeted by the local microbes and can’t adapt to the extreme conditions. And the Bacillus species from Cuatro Ciénegas are not found anywhere else in the world. “It’s just bizarre,” Cohan says, but it makes the pozas so much more valuable and worth saving. “It’s kind of a paleontological microbial park.”</p><p>In 2016, El Churince dried up just after the funding from the WWF–Carlos Slim Foundation ended. The researchers felt devastated. Souza Saldívar says it was painful to see turtle shells lying on the now-barren soil. “It’s really sad,” Olmedo Álvarez says. “It’s gone.”</p><p>On the eastern side of the basin, things are looking brighter. In 2000, the conservation nongovernmental organization Pronatura Noreste acquired the Pozas Azules ranch: 2721 hectares hosting about 100 pozas. Pronatura eventually gained rights to the water as well, enabling it to close canals draining the pozas in the ranch. Farmers are now encouraged to adopt water-sparing drip irrigation, and some are growing nopal—an edible cactus popular in Mexican cuisine—which requires much less water than alfalfa.</p><p>The researchers have focused their recent studies on Pozas Azules. In 2019, after an unusual spring rain, the team noticed alien-looking structures in the shallow waters of a site near Pozas Azules II: white microbial mats buoyed by gas. The gas appeared to be largely methane, and a genetic analysis showed the mats were teeming with archaea—230 distinct species, they report in a preprint. That makes the spot “the most diverse place of archaea that we know of,” De la Torre Zavala says.</p><p>Now, the team hopes to analyze samples from the structures, which it calls “archaean domes,” in search of the elusive Asgard archaea, organisms previously found only in the deep ocean and thought to hold clues to the evolution of simple microbes into complex eukaryotes. Although some in her team are skeptical, Souza Saldívar is convinced they will find them. “Valeria’s usually right,” De la Torre Zavala says.</p><p>Shaped and seeded with life by ancient seas, the Cuatro Ciénegas Basin lies at the foot of the distant Sierra San Marcos. The white dunes bordering the basin are made of gypsum, a legacy of a Jurassic ocean.</p><p>Such prospects have added to Souza Saldívar’s determination to preserve Cuatro Ciénegas, and she is enlisting young people for support. In every field trip since 2004, her team has spent time with students from the local high school, showing them how to use a microscope and take simple environmental measurements, and teaching them about sustainable agriculture. In 2011, with funding from the LALA Foundation and the WWF–Carlos Slim Foundation, the scientists set up a college-level molecular biology lab at the school, which is now ranked among the best rural high schools in Mexico.</p><p>Héctor Arocha Garza is one of its graduates. Inspired by the secrets of Cuatro Ciénegas, he pursued a Ph.D. in biotechnology at UANL with De la Torre Zavala, then returned to his hometown. “My heart was in Cuatro Ciénegas,” he says. Now, he’s leading the scientific branch of a privately funded megaproject called Cuatro Ciénegas 2040 that aims to build a science museum and make Cuatro Ciénegas a scientific tourism destination, while supporting education and medical care for the village’s young people.</p><p>The effort comes at a critical moment. More than 90% of the marshes are gone, and some pozas and lagoons are dry. But this year, CONAGUA committed to regulating water usage and closing illegal wells, and Pronatura Noreste will close the Saca Salada Canal, which drains the Río Mezquites, as soon as the COVID-19 pandemic permits.</p><p>Those developments, and stories like Arocha Garza’s, give Souza Saldívar hope for the future of Cuatro Ciénegas. “It has been a very complicated, long, and difficult process,” she says. But now, she wrote in a recent book, “There is a revolution occurring in this oasis: Science is the tool and kids are the drivers.”</p><p>*Clarification: 6 July, 6:25 p.m.: This article has been updated to clarify that Cuatro Ciénegas is in the Mexican state of Coahuila.</p><p> I also wish to receive emails from AAAS/Science and Science advertisers, including information on  products, services, and special offers which may include but are not limited to news, career information, & upcoming events.</p><p>© 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Kapotes, a first grade teacher in her 50s, was fighting an aggressive breast cancer that had spread through her body. She had endured grueling treatments over the previous 4 years, including whole-brain radiation therapy. She had also been taking the breast cancer medication Herceptin, but her tumors were still growing. Now, she had a chance to try something radically different: a drug called ruxolitinib, originally designed to treat cancers affecting the blood and bone marrow.</p><p>Kapotes’s oncologist, Amy Tiersten at Mount Sinai Hospital, was stunned by how well her patient responded to the new drug. It kept her cancer at bay and she had almost no side effects. “I was amazed,” Tiersten says.</p><p>The ruxolitinib trial was the product of a decadelong quest by Andrea Califano, a systems biologist at Columbia University. Using sophisticated computing, he models the molecular networks that sustain cancer cells and pinpoints proteins called transcription factors that act as linchpins, controlling the behavior of many genes inside a cell. Califano collaborated with cell biologist José Silva, then also at Columbia, to analyze breast cancer samples in a repository of tissues from other patients who had become resistant to Herceptin. Findings of the analysis suggested a transcription factor called STAT3 plays a critical role in those cancers. And ruxolitinib was known to inhibit STAT3.</p><p>Other researchers have focused on identifying genetic mutations that drive the disease in an individual patient. Doing so, the thinking goes, can help identify the best drug for each patient. But because of the diversity of cancer-causing mutations across the population, an arsenal of tens of thousands of drugs might be needed to treat everyone.</p><p>Califano’s approach, by contrast, is a twist on that idea. He has focused instead on identifying a few transcription factors that act as bottlenecks (see graphic, below). Target those master regulators, as Califano calls them, and you will stop cancer in its tracks, no matter what mutation initially caused it. Oncologists would still need to analyze each patient’s mutations to figure out which regulators are at play in their particular cancer, but instead of tens of thousands of drugs, Califano says, they may only need dozens. It’s a depersonalized approach to personalized medicine.</p><p>The strategy builds on Califano’s computational training as a physicist. “We’ve built algorithms that can reverse engineer the logic of each different tumor so that we know the targets” for drugs, he says. His algorithms are a prime example of systems biology—which uses complicated math to model intricate biological systems, such as gene interactions. It’s a field that has generated tremendous interest, but little real-world clinical success.</p><p>In 2015, Califano co-founded a company called DarwinHealth that uses his algorithms to guide doctors by identifying the key transcription factors in a patient’s tumor and suggesting drugs to target them. His work has earned praise from other researchers, although some note the approach is only in early stages of human testing, and its clinical usefulness remains uncertain. Ed Liu, president and CEO of the Jackson Laboratory, a nonprofit biomedical institute Califano has collaborated with, is optimistic the method will ultimately pay off. “As we develop more and more precise ways to attack those nodes, then the more useful his algorithms will be.”</p><p>Califano’s approach is about to get its largest test yet. Columbia has allocated $15 million for a trial of 3000 cancer patients within its hospitals over the next 3 years, using DarwinHealth algorithms to analyze each patient’s cancer and recommend treatments. “This is probably one of the most exciting moments in my research,” Califano says, “because finally we’re able to apply this methodology on a scale that is large enough to be able to really learn something in terms of the response of the patient.”</p><p>Shutting down a cancer cell’s malfunctioning gene network is a tall order if you target mutations too far upstream in the network. But disabling a transcription factor that acts as a master regulator in the cell’s genetic circuitry can cause its demise even with just one drug.</p><p>In fall of 1958, a young scientist named François Jacob went to his colleague Jacques Monod at the Pasteur Institute in Paris with a hypothesis about how genetic mechanisms might control cell behavior. Both men had renegade tendencies: Jacob had fought Nazis—and been injured—on behalf of the exiled French government in World War II, and Monod, an accomplished rock climber, had taken part in the guerilla activities of the French Resistance. Over the next few years, the pair worked together, and they were the first to demonstrate the idea of genetic circuits. The work ultimately won them a share of the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.</p><p>In experiments with Escherichia coli, Jacob and Monod showed that the gene networks in those bacteria can alter the production of certain enzymes depending on the type of food available. When the sugar lactose was abundant, the bacteria turned on genes that code for the enzymes to metabolize it. But with access only to glucose, a different sugar, the microbes shut down those genes. It was a pioneering demonstration that the activity of individual genes could be either boosted or repressed.</p><p>Experiments in later decades helped explain how the cell machinery exerts that control. One key player is transcription factors, proteins that boost or inhibit the activity of other genes. The gene-regulating network of a single cell is far more elaborate than Jacob and Monod had the tools to uncover. The human genome contains 20,000 genes, and an estimated 1500 of those produce transcription factors. That system creates a complex web of on and off switches.</p><p>Califano thought that if he could identify the key switches in cancer, he might be able to shut down the catastrophic genetic changes that drive its growth. But after he finished his training as a physicist in 1986, IBM recruited him to spearhead projects in computer vision and artificial intelligence. The building codes at the IBM facility prevented Califano from having an experimental lab to pursue his interests in biology. He left in 2000 and landed at Columbia in 2003. He started to write code to solve the riddle of cancer on the day he arrived.</p><p>Nowadays, the data underlying his algorithms come from a method called RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The method gauges gene activity within cells by sequencing RNA molecules, which act as a proxy for which genes are turned on and off. Algorithms crunch the massive amount of RNA-seq data to reveal which genes are overactive or underactive in cancer compared with healthy tissue. The algorithms then use complex equations to infer patterns of gene interactions and zero in on the transcription factors with the largest influence.</p><p>The search for key drivers of cancer isn’t easy. Consider a 2018 analysis of more than 9000 samples that reported almost 1.5 million mutations. Genes influence one another in intricate webs and feedback loops, so the number of ways those genetic perturbations might interact in a tumor is vast. “There’s, say, 1000 genes that are recurrently mutated across all tumors that may drive cancer, so you have more potential combinations of cancerous mutations than atoms in the universe,” Califano says.</p><p>The pharmaceutical industry can’t make a new drug for each of those unique combinations. (By comparison, 126 new cancer drugs received approval from the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] between 1980 and 2018.) That’s why pinpointing the master regulators that are common culprits across cancers is so crucial, Califano says.</p><p>At Columbia, he has worked with his former postdoctoral researcher Mariano Alvarez to develop more efficient algorithms for sorting through those networks. The current one, called VIPER—short for virtual inference of protein activity by enriched regulon analysis—has been used in dozens of studies of how vast, interconnected genetic networks have gone awry in bladder, prostate, and lung cancers.</p><p>Califano and colleagues recently used the VIPER algorithm to look across RNA-seq data from more than 10,000 individual tumor samples in the Cancer Genome Atlas, a database sponsored by the U.S. government. The team found that different types of cancer have more in common than previously thought. The analysis, now under review for publication, identified 407 transcription factor genes that acted as suspected linchpins across all the cancer samples. Only 20 to 25 of them were implicated in any given cancer—and Califano says fighting the cancer might not require knocking out all those transcription factors: Toppling just a few nodes might be enough.</p><p>Califano “was among the first to put the complex algorithms out there, and then others have followed,” Liu says. A strength of Califano’s algorithms is that they look at an entire network of gene products, including RNA and proteins, adds David Tuveson, director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cancer Center. Tuveson uses VIPER in his own search for treatments for pancreatic cancer.</p><p>Califano, too, hopes to put his algorithms to work for patients. The idea to commercialize that approach began in 2013, on a beach in the British Virgin Islands. There he met a fellow vacationer, Gideon Bosker, a physician who had gotten his start in emergency medicine and later launched a successful medical education company. The pair hit it off, and 2 years later they decided to form DarwinHealth. Columbia licensed the VIPER technology to DarwinHealth, and Bosker put $1.4 million of his money into the venture to get it off the ground. Since then, industry collaborators have sponsored more than a dozen research projects with the algorithms from the company.</p><p>DarwinHealth combines Califano’s algorithms with a database of information from experiments about how drugs affect multiple genes, compiled through the company’s review of the literature and other sources. As long as they follow established rules for patient tissue transfer, doctors around the world can now send a tissue sample to Columbia’s pathology department, where RNA is extracted from cells. For $1600, the company generates an “OncoTarget” readout of the individual master regulator that seems to have the biggest sway in the patient’s cancer, as well as a more sophisticated “OncoTreat” readout of existing drugs that tamp down the tumor’s 25 most activated transcription factors and boost the 25 that are most turned down. The products launched in 2018.</p><p>Gordon Mills, who serves as director of precision oncology for the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University and helped pioneer the field of systems biology, notes that Califano’s cancer-fighting algorithms still have to overcome a lot of obstacles. “There’s skepticism that we’re far enough along to be able to predict the complexity of human disease,” says Mills, who has applied Califano’s algorithms to data in his own research. “There have been hundreds of algorithms that have failed to truly capture the complexity and heterogeneity of cancer and have not panned out in attempts to move them through to the clinic.”</p><p>But Califano sees a sign that his search for cancer linchpins will pay off in an unlikely cancer success story: thalidomide. In the mid-1950s, the drug arrived on the market as a sedative to help with sleep and anxiety. Doctors also prescribed it to pregnant women for nausea—which proved devastating because it caused massive birth defects, including missing limbs and heart problems. But thalidomide has made a comeback as a medicine for diseases such as leprosy. In 1997, doctors began to test the drug against multiple myeloma, a cancer affecting white blood cells.</p><p>Scientists have since learned more about how thalidomide works. In 2018, they found it prompts a protein complex called cereblon inside cells to mark certain transcription factors for disposal. In multiple myeloma, those transcription factors, IKZF1 and IKZF3, act as linchpins in the genetic network that allows the cancer to thrive. To Califano, thalidomide’s success shows the value of finding existing drugs that can target cancer’s master regulators.</p><p>Andrea Califano (right) and Gideon Bosker (left) founded DarwinHealth to apply systems biology to cancer.</p><p>Candidates are scarce. Whereas many drugs go after proteins that act as enzymes and have easy-to-find active sites to target, transcription factors lack such readily targetable spots, and many researchers have considered them undruggable.</p><p>But Califano’s Columbia lab is trying to add to the list of potential drugs. Hulking machines with robotic arms process tumor cell samples to do high-throughput screening that looks at how candidate drugs alter the cells’ RNA-seq profile and whether the drugs reverse the activity of master regulators. A $12 million supercomputer in the basement of the building, a shared resource for university researchers, analyzes the data.</p><p>Bristol Myers Squibb, which manufactures the FDA-approved version of thalidomide for multiple myeloma, has joined the hunt. It has contracted DarwinHealth to systematically search the pharmaceutical giant’s library of compounds for other compounds that might target master regulators.</p><p>Additional support for the DarwinHealth approach comes from a recent study by Samir Parekh at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and a team of international collaborators, who recently completed a clinical trial to test a combination of two drugs, dexamethasone and selinexor, for multiple myeloma. The combination only worked in about one-quarter of patients, reducing levels of a myeloma protein in their blood. In a retrospective analysis, the DarwinHealth tools predicted which patients would respond. By assessing RNA-seq data from 12 patients, the tools identified four of the five patients who benefited from the drugs and six of the seven who did not, the researchers reported last year in The New England Journal of Medicine.</p><p>Morgan Craig, who uses computational approaches to identify new drugs at the University of Montreal, says efforts to understand molecular networks in cancer have the potential to improve personalized medicine. Algorithms like those used by DarwinHealth “may not take over clinical approaches right away,” Craig explains. “But it’s definitely a step toward trying to do this target identification in a more systematic way.”</p><p>DarwinHealth doesn’t run clinical trials, but for the past 3 years, Califano’s lab has tested the company’s algorithms in experiments at Columbia. The researchers analyzed RNA-seq data from biopsy samples from more than 100 cancer patients to identify master regulators and suggest drugs that might not normally be considered (much as DarwinHealth’s commercial service does). In a few dozen cases, the researchers later tested the drug in mice with a grafted version of a patient’s tumor to confirm the drug affected the master regulators as predicted. For five of those patients, doctors felt bold enough to try the algorithm’s suggested drug. Each patient had late-stage cancer that had already stopped responding to available treatments.</p><p>Four of those five patients responded to the drugs given, at least for a time. For one patient with a meningioma, a tumor that can exert fatal pressure on the brain, the algorithm pointed to etoposide—a drug originally designed to treat lung and ovarian cancer. His tumor stopped growing for more than a year; it then started to slightly rebound and he was put in a different clinical trial. After that, his tumor started to rapidly grow again.</p><p>Califano hopes to build on those anecdotal results with the formal clinical trial, now underway at Columbia. The Oncotarget and Oncotreat tests from DarwinHealth will be used with 3000 patients in the Columbia system. Ultimately, the drugs they receive will be chosen by a board of doctors on the basis of readouts either from mutations detected by traditional sequencing or from the VIPER-based algorithm. DarwinHealth will receive no money for the tests to avoid any conflict of interest, given that Califano is part of the company’s leadership while working at the university.</p><p>Califano and Bosker are also licensing the DarwinHealth tools to other researchers around the world to test against cancer. In January, Beijing Cancer Hospital confirmed it would be using DarwinHealth’s tools to guide treatment for patients in clinical trials there. Xiaotian Zhang, an oncologist leading the new study, says that if early results look promising, the research will be expanded to other hospitals. “These clinical studies will all focus on gastrointestinal tumors, particularly gastric and esophageal cancer,” Zhang says.</p><p>As the DarwinHealth approach goes into more clinical testing sites, more patients like Kapotes will receive drugs never intended to fight their particular cancers. For some people, like her, it might buy precious time. For more than 2 years after she enrolled in the ruxolitinib trial, Kapotes’s cancer remained stable. When scans eventually showed her tumor had started to grow again, Tiersten switched her to another medication, which had just received FDA approval. These days, Kapotes is taking time to enjoy her retirement and her family. The newly approved drug she now takes works through a different mechanism, but Kapotes never would have had the chance to take it if not for ruxolitinib. “She hung on long enough because she was in the trial,” Tiersten says.</p><p> I also wish to receive emails from AAAS/Science and Science advertisers, including information on  products, services, and special offers which may include but are not limited to news, career information, & upcoming events.</p><p>© 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

There’s no obvious top or bottom, and it is unclear which cells will give rise to which body parts. After about 14 days, the embryo elongates and forms layers, revealing a rough plan for the body. But this dramatic transformation, called gastrulation, has never been directly observed in human embryos: Growing them to this stage in a lab is technically difficult and ethically fraught. Now, researchers have made structures from human stem cells that mimic some features of embryos after gastrulation, an advance that could reveal how genetic mutations and chemical exposures can lead to miscarriages and birth defects.</p><p>“This is really the first … model that allows us to study postgastrulation development of the human embryo,” says Jianping Fu, a bioengineer at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, who was not involved in the new work. “It’s a very important step.”</p><p>Researchers have few windows into the first weeks of human life. They can observe surplus embryos created for in vitro fertilization procedures, but widely adopted ethical guidelines prohibit growing these in a lab beyond 14 days. Embryos from mice and other animals offer glimpses of how cells organize and signal to each other early in development, but they differ structurally and genetically from human embryos.</p><p>To turn human stem cells into something embryolike, researchers in the lab of developmental biologist Alfonso Martinez Arias at the University of Cambridge and collaborators modified a method they developed for mouse cells. In 2018, they showed they could create elongated, embryolike structures—so-called gastruloids—by exposing clusters of mouse embryonic stem cells to a chemical that activates a developmental signaling pathway known as Wnt.</p><p>In the new study, the researchers applied a similar treatment to a line of cells, originally derived from a human embryo, which has the potential to develop into any of the body’s cell types. In just 3 days, the cells self-organized into a structure that resembled a human embryo that is roughly 18 to 21 days old, the team reports today in Nature. Genetic analysis revealed that, like an embryo, these gastruloids have cells belonging to three main “lineages\\\" that will go on to form the body’s many tissues. And the gastruloids stretched out to create distinct front and back ends.</p><p>This is the first model in to clearly show human cells spontaneously organizing along a body axis, says Aryeh Warmflash a stem cell biologist at Rice University. Studying the gastruloids could reveal how signaling between cells drives this self-organization, he adds. However, patterns of gene expression in cells at different points along the gastruloid are somewhat disorganized, he says. For example, genes that are expected to be expressed more in the back show up in the front. “It’s not as clean as what’s been shown for the mouse.”</p><p>Meanwhile, some cells are missing altogether. The new gastruloids don’t have cells that would go on to form the brain, for example. And unlike real embryos, they don’t produce “extraembryonic” cells that would allow them to implant in a uterus and would eventually form a placenta. (Such cells are also thought to enable brain development by shielding the embryo from certain chemical signals in the uterus.) After about 3 days, the gastruloids stop developing and curl up, possibly because they buckle under their own weight, says Cambridge developmental biologist Naomi Moris, a co-author on the study.</p><p>It’s clear these gastruloids are not embryos and won’t develop into embryos, says Jeantine Lunshof, a philosopher and ethicist at Harvard Medical School. But by mimicking embryo features, such models could “resolve a lot of problems” she says, allowing researchers to study developmental stages that the 14-day limit on in vitro embryo research currently puts out of bounds.</p><p>Nothing about the method is obviously ethically concerning, agrees bioethicist Insoo Hyun of Case Western Reserve University. “But it does raise further questions that I think have to be dealt with.” For example, he says, the desire to validate these gastruloid models by comparing them to natural human development could inspire challenges to the 14-day rule. And if other researchers want to include extraembryonic cells or the precursors of brain cells in gastruloids, “What’s to stop somebody from trying to model the whole thing?”</p><p>Moris, for one, says she has no such ambition. Future studies will look in more detail at how cells of the embryo self-organize—for example, how they form somites, the blocks of tissue that go on to form structures in the torso such as muscles and vertebrae. To understand how this and other developmental processes go awry, sometimes ending a pregnancy or leading to birth defects, her group aims to introduce mutations in the stem cells used to make gastruloids, and to create gastruloids out of “reprogrammed” cells from people with congenital disorders.</p><p>For those studies, “having a simplified model system is actually beneficial,” she says, “and I think that there are still more questions than I could possibly answer in my lifetime.”</p><p>© 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

They have not sought to block government funding for the vaccines, which include two candidate vaccines that the Trump administration plans to support with an investment of up to $1.7 billion, as well as a third candidate made by a Chinese company in collaboration with Canada’s National Research Council (NRC). But they are urging funders and policymakers to ensure that companies develop other vaccines that do not rely on such human fetal cell lines and, in the United States, asking the government to “incentivize” firms to only make vaccines that don’t rely on fetal cells.</p><p>“It is critically important that Americans have access to a vaccine that is produced ethically: no American should be forced to choose between being vaccinated against this potentially deadly virus and violating his or her conscience,” members of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and 20 other religious, medical, and political organizations that oppose abortion wrote to Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in April. “Thankfully, other [COVID-19] vaccines … utilize cell lines not connected to unethical procedures and methods.”</p><p>“We urge your government to fund the development of vaccines that do not create an ethical dilemma for many Canadians,” wrote Archbishop of Winnipeg Richard Gagnon, president of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, and 17 other antiabortion religious, medical, and politic groups and individuals in a 21 May letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “The … manufacture of vaccines using such ethically-tainted human cell lines demonstrates profound disrespect for the dignity of the human person.”</p><p>FDA and senior White House officials did not respond to emails requesting comment on the letter to Hahn. In Canada, the health ministry has promised to respond to the letter to Trudeau, says Moira McQueen, executive director of the Canadian Catholic Bioethics Institute and lead signatory on the letter.</p><p>Cells derived from elective abortions have been used since the 1960s to manufacture vaccines, including current vaccines against rubella, chickenpox, hepatitis A, and shingles. They have also been used to make approved drugs against diseases including hemophilia, rheumatoid arthritis, and cystic fibrosis. Now, research groups around the world are working to develop more than 130 candidate vaccines against COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization; 10 had entered human trials as of 2 June.</p><p>At least five of the candidate COVID-19 vaccines use one of two human fetal cell lines: HEK-293, a kidney cell line widely used in research and industry that comes from a fetus aborted in about 1972; and PER.C6, a proprietary cell line owned by Janssen, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, developed from retinal cells from an 18-week-old fetus aborted in 1985. Both cell lines were developed in the lab of molecular biologist Alex van der Eb at Leiden University. Two of the five vaccines have entered human trials (see table, below).</p><p>In four of the vaccines, the human fetal cells are used as miniature “factories” to generate vast quantities of adenoviruses, disabled so that they cannot replicate, that are used as vehicles to ferry genes from the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. When the adenoviruses are given as a vaccine, recipients’ cells begin to produce proteins from the coronavirus, hopefully triggering a protective immune response.</p><p>The fifth vaccine, which has shown promise in monkeys and is headed for human trials as soon as this summer, is what is known as a protein subunit vaccine. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh use HEK-293 cells to manufacture the coronavirus’ spike protein—a vital part of its structure—which is used to trigger an immune response. The vaccine is delivered through a skin patch with 400 tiny needles.</p><p>The fetal cell lines are key to producing both types of vaccine. “HEK-293 [cells] are essential for making protein subunit vaccines,” says Andrea Gambotto, a vaccine scientist at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and the vaccine’s lead developer. Their human origin is important, he says: “Cultured [nonhuman] animal cells can produce the same proteins, but they would be decorated with different sugar molecules, which—in the case of vaccines—runs the risk of failing to evoke a robust and specific immune response.” (Among the developers of the five vaccines, only Gambotto responded to a request for comment.)</p><p>David Prentice, vice president and research director at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, which opposes abortion, notes researchers making adenovirus vaccines have modified HEK-293 cells to be adept at packaging new genes—such as those that direct cells to assemble the coronavirus spike protein—into adenoviruses. But he adds that other technologies are available, including using cells captured from amniocentesis that are engineered to make replication-deficient adenoviruses.</p><p>“The use of cells from electively aborted fetuses for vaccine production makes these five COVID-19 vaccine programs unethical, because they exploit the innocent human beings who were aborted,” Prentice and a co-author—molecular biologist James Sherley, a Lozier Institute associate scholar and director of the adult stem cell company Asymmetrex—wrote in a position paper published last month.</p><p>But Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at the New York University School of Medicine, counters: “There are better ways to win the abortion wars than telling people not to use a vaccine. These are long-over abortions. These cells are decades old, and even major religious leaders like the pope have acknowledged that for the greater good it’s not worth the symbolism to put the community at risk.”</p><p>The Vatican’s Pontifical Academy for Life declared in 2005 and reaffirmed in 2017 that in the absence of alternatives, Catholics could, in good conscience, receive vaccines made using historical human fetal cell lines.</p><p>A vaccine made by the Chinese company CanSino Biologics was the first COVID-19 vaccine to enter phase II human trials. It was developed using adapted HEK-293 cells that the company licensed from Canada’s NRC, where the cells were developed. (NRC-developed HEK-293 cells have already been used to develop an approved Ebola vaccine.) Last month, NRC announced a collaboration with CanSino Biologics under which it is preparing to run late-stage clinical trials of the vaccine in Canada, and scale up facilities to produce the vaccine in quantity.</p><p>The two U.S.-backed vaccines that have drawn criticism from antiabortion groups are on a short list of candidates targeted to get financial and logistical support from the U.S. government under the White House’s Operation Warp Speed, which aims to accelerate the development and approval of at least one COVID-19 vaccine by January 2021, according to a 3 June report in The New York Times.</p><p>One of the Warp Speed candidates, made by Janssen Research & Development, uses PER.C6 cells. The second, from University of Oxford researchers and AstraZeneca, uses HEK-293 cells. Both have received U.S. government commitments of, respectively, $456 million and $1.2 billion, if they meet milestones, through the Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority (BARDA).</p><p>Another vaccine that relies on HEK-293, being developed by two companies owned by the billionaire scientist and businessman Patrick Soon-Shiong, made an earlier, Warp Speed long list of 14 promising candidates, according to a press release from one of companies, NantKwest.</p><p>Prentice says: “As they are choosing—BARDA and the Warp Speed people— what vaccines to move ahead, they should at least recognize that there is some portion of the population who would like an alternative vaccine they can take in good conscience.”</p><p>Caplan disagrees. “If you are going to say the government shouldn’t fund things that a minority of people object to, you will have a very long list of things that won’t get funded by the government, from research on weapons of war to contraceptive research.”</p><p>The Trump administration has restricted the use of human fetal tissue from elective abortions in biomedical research. One year ago, it adopted a policy that forbids researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) from using fetal tissue from elective abortions in their studies. And it imposed an extra layer of review on non-NIH scientists seeking agency funding to do research using such tissue. But the policy did not stop either group from using decades-old fetal cell lines like HEK-293 and PER.C6.</p><p>*Clarification, 8 June, 12:10 p.m.: This story has been updated to clarify that the Vatican approves of Catholics receiving vaccines manufactured using human fetal cells only in the absence of alternatives.</p><p>© 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

For about 6 years, conventional chemotherapy helped shrink her lymphoma tumors, but they started to grow again. A succession of other cancer therapies, including a bone marrow transplant and a class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, either failed or only brought temporary relief. In one elaborate effort, physicians harvested her T cells, engineered those immune cells to kill her lymphoma, and infused them back into her body. The cancer vanished, but 2 years later bounced back. “Nothing was really working,” says oncologist Stephen Schuster of the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn).</p><p>So in October 2018, Boland joined a clinical trial testing another way to harness her immune system to kill the tumor cells. The idea of the trial, which Schuster co-leads, was to use a molecular rope known as a bispecific antibody to tether her natural T cells to the tumor cells so the immune warriors would attack. Like the engineered T cells she had received earlier, the experimental infusions sometimes made her sick enough to spend a couple of nights in the hospital. But the antibody rapidly sent her into remission. Today, more than 1 year after going off the Roche drug, mosunetuzumab, Boland, now 60, appears to be free of cancer and leads a normal life. “I’m feeling really good. I’m so grateful,” she says.</p><p>The ongoing trial Boland participated in made headlines in December 2019. At a meeting of the American Society of Hematology, Schuster reported that the antibody shrank fast-growing non-Hodgkin lymphoma tumors in 46 of 124 patients in whom other treatments had failed. For some of those people, like Boland, the failures included having their immune cells altered to attack the cancer. Those engineered cells, known as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, have achieved remarkable results in some cancers. Yet at the same meeting, data from a small clinical trial suggested a bispecific antibody might work equally well on myeloma, another blood cancer. Bispecific antibodies for cancer are “superhot,” says Janice Reichert, executive director of the Antibody Society, who has tracked their development.</p><p>That’s the culmination of a slow boil. Scientists have worked on bispecific cancer drugs for decades and the first clinical success came 12 years ago. That result jump-started the field for a while, but other therapies, including CAR T cells, raced forward, in part because the cancer-fighting antibodies proved challenging to design and produce. But companies have now made those protein drugs safer and more potent. Variants are being tested in dozens of clinical trials, in the hope they can rival or surpass the engineered cells.</p><p>“If bispecific antibodies can do what CAR T cells can do, this would represent a big advance” and a “potentially fundamental change,” said Johns Hopkins Medicine hematologist Robert Brodsky at a press preview for the meeting where Schuster presented. A major advantage of bispecific antibodies is that they can be mass-produced in advance. CAR T cells, by contrast, must be prepared for each cancer patient. That process is costly and, for some very sick patients, takes too long.</p><p>Those new players in immunotherapy are no panacea yet. For some blood cancers, the bispecific antibodies aren’t giving patients the long-lasting remissions often seen with CAR T cells. As happened with CAR T cells, several patients have died in trials testing bispecific antibodies, possibly from overzealous immune responses sparked by the drugs. And bispecific antibodies may prove less effective against solid tumors, such as those of the colon and lungs, than against blood and lymph cancers—a drawback shared with CAR T cells. “There are a lot of open questions. But it’s also a field moving quickly, and a lot of really smart people are working on it,” says Paul Carter, an antibody researcher at Genentech, a Roche subsidiary.</p><p>Antibodies have a long history as a cancer treatment. The Y-shaped proteins are normally pathogen fighters, latching onto an antigen—a protein or a bit of one—on viruses, bacteria, or other microbes. The binding, which takes place at the tips of the Y, can directly disable and clear a pathogen or can signal the immune system to attack it. Cancer researchers first learned to exploit that natural system by making many copies of a specific antibody that latches onto an antigen unique to a particular cancer. This marks the cancer for destruction by components of the immune system other than T cells. Some of the most effective, and bestselling, cancer drugs are such monoclonal antibodies, including the breast cancer drug trastuzumab, better known as Herceptin.</p><p>Newer anticancer strategies enlist T cells. Tumor cells can appear foreign enough for the body to sometimes “train” these cells to attack them. But CAR T cells, altered to carry a receptor that targets a cancer cell antigen, can deliver a more powerful response. Checkpoint inhibitors, drugs that release the molecular brakes that can restrain T cells, can also boost the T cell attack.</p><p>Bispecific antibodies offer a third way to harness T cells. In the mid-1980s, cancer researchers began to engineer antibodies that had two tips—one matched to a cancer cell antigen and the other to a T cell surface protein called CD3. The idea was to directly link T cells to tumor cells, thereby skipping the need for T cells to learn to attack a cancer. “It’s mimicking what naturally happens, but the advantage is that you can engage all T cells,” not just those trained to attack the tumor, says Dirk Nagorsen, a vice president and cancer researcher at Amgen. In 1985, the field was galvanized by two reports in Nature that such a “bispecific” antibody could destroy cancer cells in a dish; studies soon showed those antibodies could shrink tumors in mice.</p><p>The drugs were hard to make. Antibodies are modular, with two identical “heavy” chains, making up the stem and half of each arm of the Y, and two identical “light” chains, each of which completes one arm. Trying to assemble bispecific antibodies from those complex components, protein chemists got 10 versions of each molecule. That outcome meant laborious efforts to sift out the one researchers wanted.</p><p>And the excitement faded when tests of bispecific antibodies moved from lab animals and cells to cancer patients. In an early clinical trial, one antibody appeared to shrink lymphoma. But researchers had to stop treating patients before the study yielded definitive results because the antibody’s maker ran out of the drug. The antibodies also sometimes triggered serious side effects, including liver damage and an immune overreaction in which white blood cells pump out signals called cytokines that can be toxic in large quantities. Such cytokine “storms” cause fevers and, in severe cases, organ damage. (CAR T cells can cause the same overreaction.)</p><p>Two immunologists at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Peter Kufer and Gert Riethmüller, pressed ahead anyway with an idea some colleagues thought would fail: a stripped-down bispecific antibody with two tips linked by a flexible peptide instead of the traditional stem. The simplified design made the antibody easier to manufacture, but because the stem was missing, the kidneys cleared it from the blood within 2 hours. In its first clinical test, for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, patients had to wear a pump to continually infuse the antibody. Still, tiny doses of the drug shrank tumors in all seven lymphoma patients in the trial, run by Micromet, a German biotech Riethmüller co-founded. “We thought, ‘Oh my God, there’s something amazing happening here,’” says molecular biologist Patrick Baeuerle, then–chief scientific officer of Micromet, who dubbed the concept a bispecific T cell engager (trademarked as BiTE).</p><p>The small trial, published in Science in 2008, sparked interest from companies and academics. “The whole field realized, ‘This is a big deal. We want in on this,’” says John Desjarlais, chief scientific officer of the biotech Xencor. At about the same time, CAR T cells began to show impressive results in some leukemia patients—which boosted interest in other, potentially simpler immunotherapies such as bispecific antibodies. Like CAR T cells, T cells stimulated by BiTEs release toxic molecules called granzymes and perforins that punch holes in tumor cells and cause them to self-destruct. “I see bispecifics [such as BiTEs] as an off-the-shelf CAR T cell,” says Elad Sharon, senior investigator with the National Cancer Institute’s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program.</p><p>The first bispecific antibody for cancer was approved in Europe in 2009. It was meant to mop up the malignant cells that cause abdominal fluid to build up in some cancer patients—but it didn’t work that well, so the drug only stayed on the market a few years. The field regained momentum, however, after Amgen snapped up Micromet in 2012 and later showed that its BiTE drug, blinatumomab (Blincyto), doubled the survival time of patients with advanced acute lymphocytic leukemia. Beginning in 2014, the Food and Drug Administration approved the drug to treat several adult and pediatric forms of the disease. Amgen is now testing BiTEs for other cancers, including myeloma and lung, prostate, and brain cancers.</p><p>Others have rushed to improve on BiTEs by using protein engineering tricks to create desired bispecific antibodies. Some firms have restored the antibodies’ stem, known as the Fc receptor, so that the protein stays in the blood longer—but with modifications that make it less toxic to the liver. Cancer patients such as Boland no longer have to wear a fanny pack containing a pump, but can now receive the drug as an intravenous drip every 3 weeks.</p><p>Industry scientists have also added a second copy of the tumor antigen–binding site to one tip of the antibody (see graphic, above). Known as a “2+1” bispecific antibody, this particular design is meant to make the antibody more selective for cancer cells and less likely to target healthy cells carrying small amounts of the cancer antigen.</p><p>To reduce the risk of triggering a cytokine storm, researchers are also designing bispecifics that, instead of T cells, snag a different kind of immune cells called natural killers (NK). Several companies have started or are readying clinical trials of such antibodies, which bind to an NK cell surface protein called CD16. “NK cells are very potent tumor cell killers if activated, and the cytokine release is significantly reduced with this cell type,” says Dmitri Wiederschain, head of cancer immunology at one such company, Sanofi.</p><p>These variants and scores of other bispecifics are easier to synthesize now. “Antibody engineering has become so sophisticated, it’s possible to make these molecules quite efficiently,” says biochemist Christoph Rader of Scripps Research in Jupiter, Florida.</p><p>By Reichert’s count, more than 60 T cell–directing bispecific antibodies for cancer are in early- or later-stage clinical trials. One Amgen BiTE has shown hints of shrinking tumors in a few patients with advanced prostate cancer, the company reported last year.</p><p>Amy Boland’s cancer scans showed a dramatic disappearance of her lymphoma tumors from the start of her bispecific antibody treatment (left) to 12 weeks later.</p><p>Solid tumors are a challenging target for bispecifics in part because tumors often lack a unique antigen for the antibodies to grab. Many tumors are also surrounded by blood vessels, tissue, and immune cells that form a barrier T cells can’t easily penetrate. But findings from mouse studies suggest some bispecific antibodies can drive T cells into tumors, says Nai-Kong Cheung of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. His lab has systematically tweaked design factors, such as how binding sites are arranged, to learn what optimizes the molecules’ potency.</p><p>And some companies hope to boost the attack on solid tumors with antibodies that bind not only to CD3, but also to another receptor on T cells known as a “second signal,” which stimulates the cells to grow. For years, says Regeneron Senior Vice President Israel Lowy, industry has been “afraid to touch” that protein, called CD28, because of a devastating mishap: An antibody designed to bind to it made six healthy volunteers critically ill from cytokine release syndrome in a 2006 U.K. clinical trial.</p><p>Findings from new studies, however, suggest it’s possible to exploit that cell growth trigger safely. Last year in Nature Cancer, a Sanofi team reported that a “trispecific” antibody with arms matched to CD28, CD3, and a cancer antigen wiped out myeloma tumors in mice. Other firms have split up the task by creating two bispecifics. One targets a tumor antigen and CD28 or another growth-signal receptor; the other binds to the tumor antigen plus CD3. “One of our hopes is that this costimulatory bispecific may help us unlock responses in solid tumors,” says Lowy, whose company reported in Science Translational Medicine in January that such a two-drug combination shrank ovarian tumors and slowed prostate tumor growth in mice.</p><p>Could those next-generation bispecifics eclipse CAR T cells for some cancers? UPenn’s Carl June, a CAR T cell pioneer, is skeptical. Many leukemia patients who get blinatumomab eventually relapse because cancer cells become resistant to the drug, he notes, so oncologists use it mainly as a “bridge” until a very sick patient can get a stem cell transplant or CAR T cells. June adds that bispecifics may not work in the many cancer patients whose T cells have become depleted or “exhausted,” leaving too few to attack the cancer. CAR T cell treatment, by contrast, replenishes the immune ranks by growing the cells outside the body—something “not possible with bispecifics,” June says.</p><p>Schuster, who has a foot in both camps—he runs Boland’s study and has led CAR T trials with June—says bispecifics are still proving themselves. He points to an Amgen report last year that some lymphoma patients who responded well to blinatumomab were still alive after 7 years, suggesting they could stay in remission long term. “I am confident that within the next 2 to 5 years you’re going to see quantum leaps in our ability to target resistant tumors, including solid tumors,” Schuster says.</p><p>He and other cancer researchers see CAR T cells, checkpoint inhibitors, and bispecific antibodies as interchangeable. “Why not do all of the above?” asks Schuster, who’s preparing a trial that will give patients CAR T cells and then a bispecific drug. “All these approaches to manipulate the cellular immune system to treat cancer are essentially different means to the same end.” Doubling up the treatments can be risky, however—last year, two patients died in such a trial after developing cytokine release syndrome.</p><p>Boland, who has seen all three of her children grow up and go off to college during her cancer fight, welcomes the progress. A bispecific drug is keeping her lymphoma in check for now, she notes. “I hope it’ll last, but if not, I feel confident that there’s always more treatments. You just don’t worry about it. Nobody knows what will happen.”</p><p> I also wish to receive emails from AAAS/Science and Science advertisers, including information on  products, services, and special offers which may include but are not limited to news, career information, & upcoming events.</p><p>© 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

And many of these are good guys; the microbes in our gut help us digest food, for example, whereas those on our tongue and skin can guard against invading pathogens. Now, researchers have found beneficial bacteria in our nose as well. This “nasal microbiome” may guard against chronic sinus inflammation or even allergies.</p><p>The study is “an important gateway” to recognizing bacteria’s protective qualities in a new part of the body, says Maria Marco, a microbiologist at the University of California, Davis, who was not involved with the work. “There’s been some work done in the past, but this is the first study that goes in depth.”</p><p>To conduct the study, researchers co-led by Sarah Lebeer, a microbiologist at the University of Antwerp, went sleuthing for bacteria in the noses of 100 healthy people. Then, the scientists compared the microbes they found with those from hundreds of patients with chronic nasal and sinus inflammation.</p><p>Of the 30 most common types of microbes the team discovered, one group stood out: antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory bacteria called Lactobacillus. These were up to 10 times more abundant in the noses of healthy people, the researchers publish today in Cell Reports.</p><p>Lactobacilli usually thrive in oxygen-poor areas, so Lebeer was surprised to see them in an organ flush with fresh air. But a closer look revealed that the particular strain her team found in human noses has special genes called catalases that safely neutralize oxygen—a rarity among other lactobacilli. “They seem to have adapted to that environment,” Lebeer says.</p><p>Under a microscope, the researchers could also see tiny, hairlike appendages called fimbriae that anchor the bacteria to the nose’s inner surface. Lebeer thinks the microbes may also use the hairs to bind to receptors on skin cells inside the nose, prompting the cells to close like a trap door. With fewer cells open, allergens and harmful bacteria have a harder time getting inside them.</p><p>But on its own, the presence of Lactobacillus in healthy people is not enough to say it guards against disease, Lebeer admits. Whether the microbes are protective is also difficult to test in animal models such as mice, which have very different noses.</p><p>And some experts aren’t convinced that the lactobacilli the team found are uniquely adapted to the human nose. The mouth is also home to millions of lactobacilli, notes Jens Walter, a microbiologist at University College Cork, and these could end up in the nose through sneezing. The results of the study are “the right first steps,” Walter says, but he would like to see more research to reinforce their novelty and potential benefits.</p><p>Ultimately, Lebeer hopes to develop therapeutics using nasal probiotics. Sinus conditions have few treatments, and chronic conditions that must be continually treated raise the risk of a bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics. Introducing beneficial strains of bacteria lacking antibiotic resistance genes would be a lower risk solution, she says.</p><p>As a first step, Lebeer has developed a nasal spray containing the Lactobacillus microbes her team isolated.

They destroy infected and cancerous cells, and now, research reveals new details about how they do it. The cells bombard their targets with protein “bombs” packed with deadly chemicals.</p><p>The study “is clearly a significant step forward in refining our knowledge” about how these immune sentinels take out dangerous cells, says immunologist David Masopust of the University of Minnesota Medical School.</p><p>One of a killer T cell’s most important weapons is perforin, a protein that punctures the outer membrane of the target cell. Enzymes called granzymes that the T cell also releases can then pour in and trigger the victim to commit suicide. Whether killer T cells just squirt out granzymes and perforin or rely on specialized structures to transport the lethal molecules to the target cell has not been clear.</p><p>To find out, immunologist Michael Dustin of the University of Oxford and colleagues tracked molecules spilled by attacking killer T cells. Their results, reported today in Science, suggest the cells package the molecules into containers the team calls supramolecular attack particles, or SMAPs. By analyzing the payloads of these bombs, the scientists discovered that SMAPs contain not just perforin and granzymes, but also more than 280 other kinds of proteins.</p><p>For a closer look at SMAPs’ structure, the researchers turned to a type of superresolution imaging known as direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, which can pinpoint individual molecules. Cells release some types of small particles that are swaddled in lipids, but SMAPs sport a protein coat and harbor granzyme and perforin in their core. Instead of just leaking perforin and granzymes, killer T cells fashion a complex receptacle to deliver them, the researchers conclude.</p><p>To simulate the interactions between killer T cells and their victims, Dustin and his team placed the T cells on a double layer of lipids that is similar to the membrane that encloses cells. SMAPs rapidly showed up on the membrane, suggesting the T cells began to discharge them after latching on.</p><p>When the researchers plucked the killer T cells off the surface, some SMAPs remained behind. Like molecular mines, they could kill cells for up to 1 day, the team reports. Studies going back as far as the 1980s may have detected signs of SMAPs, Dustin says, but until recently researchers didn’t have the imaging technology to probe their structure.</p><p>Immunologist Christopher Mody of the University of Calgary says the paper deserves credit for “suggesting a new paradigm” for how perforin and granzymes converge at the target cell’s membrane. However, he cautions that the authors have not demonstrated whether killer T cells make and then release SMAPs or release the components, which then assemble into SMAPs at the target.</p><p>SMAPs’ complex contents suggest they may also have other functions, Dustin says. For example, the particles contain molecules that attract immune cells and manipulate their behavior, hinting that communication could be one of their roles. “We know they are important for killing, but we suspect it’s more than that,” Dustin says.</p><p> I also wish to receive emails from AAAS/Science and Science advertisers, including information on  products, services, and special offers which may include but are not limited to news, career information, & upcoming events.</p><p>© 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

An earnest and focused microbiologist who trained in Russia and loves classical music, she’s standing in front of a large anaerobic chamber in a lab at Holobiome, a small startup company here. She reaches into the glass-fronted chamber through Michelin Man–like sleeves to begin to dilute the sample inside. That’s the first step toward isolating and culturing bacteria that Gavrish and her Holobiome colleagues hope will produce new treatments for depression and other disorders of the brain and nervous system.</p><p>The eight-person company plans to capitalize on growing evidence from epidemiological and animal studies that link gut bacteria to conditions as diverse as autism, anxiety, and Alzheimer’s disease. Since its founding a mere 5 years ago, Holobiome has created one of the world’s largest collections of human gut microbes. The company’s CEO, Phil Strandwitz, cannot yet say exactly what form the new treatments will take. But the targeted ailments include depression and insomnia, as well as constipation, and visceral pain like that typical of irritable bowel syndrome—conditions that may have neurological as well as intestinal components. Strandwitz, a mild-mannered Midwesterner with a Ph.D. in microbiology, isn’t prone to visionary statements, but neither is he short on ambition: He predicts the first human trial will start within 1 year.</p><p>The allure is simple: Drug development for neuropsychiatric disorders has lagged for decades, and many existing drugs don’t work for all patients and cause unwanted side effects. A growing number of researchers see a promising alternative in microbe-based treatments, or “psychobiotics,” a term coined by neuropharmacologist John Cryan and psychiatrist Ted Dinan, both at University College Cork. “This is a really young and really exciting field with a huge amount of potential,” says Natalia Palacios, an epidemiologist at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, who is looking into connections between gut microbes and Parkinson’s disease.</p><p>Some researchers prefer a less hurried approach focused on understanding the underlying biology. But Holobiome and a few other companies are eager to cash in on the burgeoning, multibillion-dollar market that has already sprung up for other microbial therapies, which aim to treat conditions including intestinal disorders, allergies, and obesity. Those companies are pushing ahead despite many unresolved questions about how psychobiotic therapies might actually work and the potential dangers of moving too fast. “There’s a gold rush mentality,” says Rob Knight, a microbiologist at the University of California (UC), San Diego.</p><p>Over the past 20 years, the recognition that the microbes living inside us outnumber our body’s own cells has turned our view of ourselves inside out. The gut microbiome, as it’s known, weighs about 2 kilograms—more than the 1.4-kilogram human brain—and may have just as much influence over our bodies. Thousands of species of microbes (not only bacteria but also viruses, fungi, and archaea) reside in the gut. And with as many as 20 million genes among them, those microbes pack a genomic punch that our measly 20,000 genes can’t match. Gut bacteria can make and use nutrients and other molecules in ways the human body can’t—a tantalizing source of new therapies.</p><p>The brain is the newest frontier, but it’s one with an old connection to the gut. The ancient Greeks, for example, believed mental disorders arose when the digestive tract produced too much black bile. And long before microbes were discovered, some philosophers and physicians argued that the brain and gut were partners in shaping human behavior. “What probably happens is that our brain and our gut are in constant communication,” says Cryan, who over the past decade has helped drive efforts to decode those communications.</p><p>Epidemiological researchers have turned up intriguing connections between gut and brain disorders. For example, many people with irritable bowel syndrome are also depressed, people on the autism spectrum tend to have digestive problems, and people with Parkinson’s are prone to constipation.</p><p>Researchers have also noticed an increase in depression in people taking antibiotics—but not antiviral or antifungal medications that leave gut bacteria unharmed. Last year, Jeroen Raes, a microbiologist at the Catholic University of Leuven, and colleagues analyzed the health records of two groups—one Belgian, one Dutch—of more than 1000 people participating in surveys of their types of gut bacteria. People with depression had deficits of the same two bacterial species, the authors reported in April 2019 in Nature Microbiology.</p><p>Researchers see ways in which gut microbes could influence the brain. Some may secrete messenger molecules that travel though the blood to the brain. Other bacteria may stimulate the vagus nerve, which runs from the base of the brain to the organs in the abdomen. Bacterial molecules might relay signals to the vagus through recently discovered “neuropod” cells that sit in the lining of the gut, sensing its biochemical milieu, including microbial compounds. Each cell has a long “foot” that extends outward to form a synapselike connection with nearby nerve cells, including those of the vagus.</p><p>Indirect links may also exist. Increasingly, researchers see inflammation as a key factor in disorders such as depression and autism. Gut bacteria are key to proper immune system development and maintenance, and studies show that having the wrong mix of microbes can derail that process and promote inflammation. And microbial products may influence what are known as enteroendocrine cells, which reside in the lining of the gut and release hormones and other peptides. Some of those cells help regulate digestion and control insulin production, but they also release the neurotransmitter serotonin, which escapes the gut and travels throughout the body.</p><p>Finding the perfect psychobiotic requires culturing, identifying, and testing new gut microbes, work that keeps the Holobiome team busy.</p><p>Although the mechanisms remain elusive, animal studies by Cryan and others have bolstered the idea that gut microbes can influence the brain. Rats and mice given fecal transplants from people with Parkinson’s, schizophrenia, autism, or depression often develop the rodent equivalents of those problems. Conversely, giving those animals fecal transplants from healthy people sometimes relieves their symptoms. The presence or absence of certain microbes in young mice affects how the mice respond to stress as adults, and other mouse studies have pointed to a role for microbes in the development of the nervous system.</p><p>At their lab, Cryan, Dinan, and their colleague Gerard Clarke think the amino acid tryptophan, which some gut bacteria produce, could be a causal link. Microbes or the body’s own cells can convert tryptophan into serotonin, a neurotransmitter implicated in depression and other psychiatric disorders. Cells also turn tryptophan into a substance called kynurenine, which reacts further to form products that can be toxic to neurons. Changes in the microbiome might tip the production of those various substances in a way that impairs mental health, Cryan says. Research has shown, for example, that people with depression convert tryptophan into kynurenine more readily than into serotonin.</p><p>Cryan’s group has amassed scores of papers and reviews that have helped solidify the case for microbial effects on several psychological and neurological disorders. But teasing effective fixes out of those links will be difficult, Clarke says: “It is one thing to know that a particular aspect of host physiology is influenced by our gut microbes and quite another to bend this influence to our will.”</p><p>Clarke’s group collaborates and consults with many companies and has tested some potential psychobiotics for stress management in healthy volunteers. But he sees a long road to treatments. “It will be important to understand better and more precisely the mechanisms at play.”</p><p>Holobiome isn’t as patient. Strandwitz founded the company in 2015 while still a graduate student in Kim Lewis’s microbiology lab at Northeastern University. “He very politely told me that he would join the lab only if I helped him start a company once he graduated,” recalls Lewis, who is famous for discovering and working to commercialize new antibiotics from soil microbes. Lewis agreed, but he figured it would be 10 years or more before Strandwitz would have his own company. Lewis was wrong: It only took 4 years.</p><p>At Northeastern, Strandwitz learned what he calls the “art of cultivation” from Gavrish, who was working with Lewis on isolating soil microbes. At the time, only about 25% of gut bacteria could be grown in the lab. Gavrish, who specializes in isolating and describing new microbial species, taught Strandwitz to manipulate nutrients and use antibiotics to give slow-growing, picky bacteria a chance to survive in culture instead of being outcompeted by more aggressive species. He began to track down growth factors to keep recalcitrant species going. Now, Strandwitz says, “We have in culture about 70%” of the known human gut microbes. If true, it’s a figure few other labs can match.</p><p>One growth factor Strandwitz identified turned out to be the key to launching his entrepreneurial dreams. He and colleagues isolated a bacterium that couldn’t survive on typical culture media and required an amino acid called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to thrive. GABA is a neurotransmitter that inhibits neural activity in the brain, and its misregulation has been linked to depression and other mental health problems.</p><p>The researchers reasoned that if this gut microbe had to have GABA, some other microbe must be making it. Such GABA producers might be a psychobiotic gold mine. Strandwitz and colleagues began to add gut microbes one at a time to petri dishes containing the GABA eater. If the GABA eater thrived, the scientists would know they’d found a GABA producer. They discovered such producers among three groups of bacteria, including Bactereroides. They quickly filed a patent for packaging those bacteria—or their products—to treat people with depression or other mental disorders.</p><p>At Holobiome, Stephen Skolnick tests whether bacterial cells can make GABA, an important neurotransmitter.</p><p>Before publishing those findings, the group teamed up with researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine who were doing a brain scan study of 23 people diagnosed with depression. They found that people with fewer Bacteroides bacteria had a stronger pattern of hyperactivity in the prefrontal cortex, which some researchers have associated with severe depression. The collaboration reported its findings on 10 December 2018 in Nature Microbiology, along with the discovery of GABA-producing bacteria.</p><p>Holobiome further discovered that the bacteria produce GABA in the rat digestive tract, which may increase GABA levels in the brain. And it found that GABA producers reduced learned helplessness—a symptom of depression—in those animals. One of Strandwitz’s co-authors, microbial ecologist Jack Gilbert at UC San Diego, is also testing the therapeutic potential of GABA-producing bacteria in rats. His group and Holobiome have both observed that treated rats are more likely to stay longer on an uncomfortably warm surface—a test of visceral pain tolerance—perhaps because elevated GABA calms them. The findings are unpublished, but they’ve persuaded Gilbert to investigate whether those bacteria can also reduce anxiety in rats. “It’s clear they do have a neuromodulatory effect,” he says.</p><p>GABA is too big to reach the brain by slipping across the blood-brain barrier, a cellular defense wall that limits the size and types of molecules that can get into the brain from blood vessels. Instead, the molecule may act through the vagus nerve or the enteroendocrine cells. Some researchers might question why bacteria would be any more beneficial than GABA-boosting drugs. But Strandwitz says the bacteria may do more than simply boost GABA. He notes that they produce molecules that may have other effects on the brain and body, thereby addressing other symptoms of depression.</p><p>He and Gilbert are unfazed by those uncertainties. “If we can show an influence, without any side effects, I don’t see any reason for not going forward with clinical trials,” Gilbert says.</p><p>At Holobiome, Strandwitz and colleagues have identified and ranked 30 promising GABA-producing bacteria, including the ones Gilbert is testing. Now, the company is enlisting an outside manufacturer to figure out which GABA-producing bacteria are best suited to produce in large enough quantities to test in people. The researchers hope to complete regulatory and ethical reviews in time to start human trials by early 2021. “We’ve been able to progress at this rate because we know our microbiology,” Strandwitz says. The initial target conditions are insomnia and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation.</p><p>Ultimately, Holobiome does not know whether its best products will be a single bacterial species, a group of species, or a compound made by bacteria. “For now, live bugs work the best,” Strandwitz says. He suggests a consortium of bacteria that includes a wider range of species than typical probiotics will be more versatile and able to treat multiple aspects of, say, depression.</p><p>Holobiome is already looking beyond GABA producers. Thousands of newly isolated microbes wait in frozen vials at the company’s headquarters for their psychobiotic potential to be explored. “Whenever we see someone publishes a new paper on the microbiome, we can check if we have those bacteria and replicate the experiments,” says Holobiome’s Stephen Skolnick, who recently joined the company.</p><p>A key tool for those experiments is a “gut simulator,” a series of flasks connected by tubing, with several portals for adding microbes and for monitoring what’s happening inside. By allowing a mock microbiome to develop from different combinations of bacteria, sometimes with mammalian cells in the mix, the researchers can investigate newly isolated microbes and their products. If the scientists see promise, they can quickly pivot to thinking about additional products to develop.</p><p>Holobiome’s Mariaelena Caboni examines mammalian cells used to assess how microbes affect nerve cell signaling in their hosts.</p><p>Skolnick took the lead on obtaining a patent for Holobiome’s use of queuine—a vitaminlike molecule only produced by certain gut microbes—to improve mental well-being. The body uses queuine to build neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and melatonin. Whether adding queuine producers or the molecule itself to the gut might help people with mental illness isn’t clear, but Strandwitz says he’s excited about the idea.</p><p>“It’s been amazing to witness the tremendous growth in the microbiome gut-brain field,” says UC Los Angeles biologist Elaine Hsiao. Like Strandwitz, she is an enthusiast, having helped start two companies to develop microbial therapies for several disorders, including epilepsy and autism.</p><p>Other researchers fear entrepreneurship is outracing science. Knight says venture capitalists are funding startups developing almost any microbiome-based therapies. Some concepts are “very promising and are supported by a lot of evidence,” he says, but others aren’t, and they’re still getting money. Knight says investors see an opportunity in eager patients. (Raes says he gets almost daily emails from depressed people seeking help.)</p><p>Microbial therapies won’t necessarily meet the same standards of efficacy as regular drugs. To be marketed as a pharmaceutical, a treatment has to pass muster with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or its equivalent in other countries, through clinical trials that prove its effectiveness against specific diseases. Most microbiome treatments so far are marketed as probiotics, for which regulatory thresholds are lower, at least in the United States—as are limits on the health claims that a manufacturer can make. Holobiome is developing both types of products.</p><p>The field still faces considerable scientific questions, too. Besides the correlative nature of much of the research and the usual questions of whether animal studies will translate to humans, there’s also the sheer complexity of the human microbiome, says Beatriz Peñalver Bernabé, a systems reproductive biologist at the University of Illinois, Chicago. “I don’t think that it will be ‘one thing fits all.’ We will need to look for specific strains and dosages for different people.” And, she adds, new theories and models are needed to predict how those strains will affect the individual’s particular microbiome community.</p><p>Despite the obstacles, Gavrish remains confident that some strains she’s growing in the anaerobic chamber will lead to treatments. After all, she says, the connection between gut microbes and the human brain has deep evolutionary roots. “I truly believe you can harness the power of a million years of signaling by gut bacteria to help people.”</p><p>*Correction, 11 May, 11 a.m.: This article has been edited to clarify that queuine is not a building block for neurotransmitters and that GABA producers, not eaters, were found to reduce learned helplessness.</p><p>© 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Each of these DNA variants, most likely inherited from our parents, can reduce life span by as much as 6 months, the researchers estimate. And different combinations can dictate how long people live before developing age-related diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and dementia.</p><p>A person’s genes don’t set a specific natural life span—diet and many other factors play large roles, too—but studies have shown that DNA variants can influence the aging process. Biologists chalk up less than one-third of that influence to the genes we inherit. The source of other age-influencing DNA variation is environmental: Sun damage, chemical exposure, and other insults that create thousands of random mutations. Each cell’s collection of these environmental mutations differs, and most don’t greatly impact a person’s life span.</p><p>Hunting for these rare mutations, which are found in less than one in every 10,000 people, required a group effort. Harvard University geneticist Vadim Gladyshev, a senior co-author in the new study, partnered with academic colleagues and a biotech company called Gero LLC to scour the UK Biobank, a public database containing the genotypes of about 500,000 volunteers.</p><p>Using more than 40,000 of these genotypes, the team looked for correlations between small changes in DNA and health conditions, a so-called genomewide association study. Specifically, the variants they were targeting knock out genes entirely, depriving all the cells in the body of certain proteins.</p><p>On average, each person is born with six ultrarare variants that can decrease life span and “health span,” the amount of time people live before developing serious diseases, the team reports this month in eLife. The more mutations, the more likely a person was to develop an age-related illness at a younger age or die. “The exact combination matters,” Gladyshev says, but in general, each mutation decreases life span by 6 months and health span by 2 months.</p><p>The results build on what is already known about aging: “Family genes” matter. But rather than studying the common mutations found in especially long-lived people, researchers can now target rarer variants present in everyone. Gladyshev hopes this information can be used in clinical trials to categorize participants by their mutations in addition to things like gender and actual age.</p><p>He admits the findings are potentially controversial, as they minimize the perceived contribution to aging of environmental “somatic” mutations acquired throughout life. Somatic mutations “live in a larger universe of age-related changes” influenced by lifestyle, he says, adding that changes to hormone and gene expression also come with age. “They [all] contribute to the aging process, but on their own they do not cause it.”</p><p>Jan Vijg, a geneticist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine who studies the role of somatic mutations in aging, agrees, though he adds that somatic mutations can still cause diseases such as skin cancer that decrease life span.</p><p>Alexis Battle, a biomedical engineer at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, points to an important caveat, however: The new research only looked at the “exome,” the 1% of the genome that actively builds the proteins that direct our cells. The rest is largely a black box, although growing evidence shows it can affect gene expression. Both Battle and Vijg agree that this DNA could be even more important in aging than the regions targeted by Gladyshev and his colleagues.</p><p>Going forward, Gladyshev would like to repeat his analysis on DNA from centenarians: those that live to be older than 100. “Most of the previous research focused on what these people have that makes them long-lived,” he says. “But [we want to look at] the opposite—it’s what they don’t have.”</p><p>doi:10.1126/science.abc4494</p><p>\\n  By Jon CohenSep. 3, 2020</p><p>\\n  By Jon CohenSep. 3, 2020</p><p>\\n  By Science's News StaffSep. 2, 2020</p><p>\\n  By Kai KupferschmidtSep. 1, 2020</p><p>\\n  By Emiliano Rodríguez MegaSep. 1, 2020</p><p>More ScienceInsider</p><p>\\n  By Jocelyn KaiserAug. 28, 2020</p><p>\\n  By Lucy HicksAug. 28, 2020</p><p>\\n  By Rebekah TuchschererAug. 26, 2020</p><p>\\n  By Rasha AridiAug. 21, 2020</p><p>\\n  By Cathleen O’GradyAug. 21, 2020</p><p>More Sifter</p><p>\\n  Vol 369,\\n\\n      Issue 6508  </p><p>© 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

People around the world do carry traces of Neanderthals in their genomes. But a study of tens of thousands of Icelanders finds their Neanderthal legacy had little or no impact on most of their physical traits or disease risk.</p><p>Paleogeneticists realized about 10 years ago that most Europeans and Asians inherited 1% to 2% of their genomes from Neanderthals. And Melanesians and Australian Aboriginals get another 3% to 6% of their DNA from Denisovans, Neanderthal cousins who ranged across Asia 50,000 to 200,000 years ago or so.</p><p>A steady stream of studies suggested gene variants from these archaic peoples might raise the risk of depression, blood clotting, diabetes, and other disorders in living people. The archaic DNA may also be altering the shape of our skulls; boosting our immune systems; and influencing our eye color, hair color, and sensitivity to the Sun, according to scans of genomic and health data in biobanks and medical databases.</p><p>But the new study, which looked for archaic DNA in living Icelanders, challenges many of those claims. Researchers from Aarhus University in Denmark scanned the full genomes of 27,566 Icelanders in a database at deCODE Genetics in Iceland, seeking unusual archaic gene variants. The researchers ended up with a large catalog of 56,000 to 112,000 potentially archaic variants—and a few surprises.</p><p>They found, for example, that Icelanders had inherited 3.3% of their archaic DNA from Denisovans and 12.2% from unknown sources. (84.5% came from close relatives of the reference Neanderthals.)</p><p>Next, the researchers calculated the association of the Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA with 271 traits. Unlike most previous studies, the team examined whole genomes, which allowed them to evaluate whether modern human genes were also influencing traits. They found that most traits were better explained by association with modern gene variants. Only five traits were notably influenced by archaic DNA, the researchers report today in Nature. Men with one archaic variant had a slightly reduced chance of prostate cancer, and both men and women carrying two other variants may have reduced height and accelerated blood clotting, says bioinformatician Laurits Skov, a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, who led the research while at Aarhus and deCODE. </p><p>Contrary to previous studies, the researchers found no statistically significant association between archaic DNA and freckles, hair color, eye color, or autoimmune diseases like Crohn disease and lupus. They conclude that Neanderthal DNA only has small effects on complex traits such as height or depression, in which many genes interact. (The team did not examine immune function or cranial shape, for which there is strong evidence of Neanderthal influence.)</p><p>Population geneticist Joshua Akey of Princeton University says the discovery of Denisovan DNA in Icelanders is “fascinating.” He notes that it likely didn’t come from a Denisovan who paddled to Iceland, but from a Neanderthal or modern human who mixed it up with a Denisovan long before present-day Icelanders reached the island.</p><p>But he adds that the relatively small impact of Neanderthal DNA on most traits is not surprising given that our genomes are mostly modern DNA. Max Planck computational biologist Janet Kelso agrees, but says archaic DNA may have different effects in Icelanders than in other populations.</p><p>For now, says geneticist Kári Stefánsson, CEO of deCODE and lead author of the study, “We [just] have to swallow the fact” that Neanderthal DNA doesn’t make as much of a difference as previous studies claimed. But his team has further work planned to clinch the case: They will study how Neanderthal and Denisovan genes are expressed by studying levels of more than 5000 proteins in Icelanders in the deCODE data base.</p><p>doi:10.1126/science.abc3998</p><p>Ann is a contributing correspondent for Science.</p><p>\\n  By Jon CohenSep. 3, 2020</p><p>\\n  By Jon CohenSep. 3, 2020</p><p>\\n  By Science's News StaffSep. 2, 2020</p><p>\\n  By Kai KupferschmidtSep. 1, 2020</p><p>\\n  By Emiliano Rodríguez MegaSep. 1, 2020</p><p>More ScienceInsider</p><p>\\n  By Jocelyn KaiserAug. 28, 2020</p><p>\\n  By Lucy HicksAug. 28, 2020</p><p>\\n  By Rebekah TuchschererAug. 26, 2020</p><p>\\n  By Rasha AridiAug. 21, 2020</p><p>\\n  By Cathleen O’GradyAug. 21, 2020</p><p>More Sifter</p><p>\\n  Vol 369,\\n\\n      Issue 6508  </p><p>© 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Days earlier, his rounds had been interrupted as his team tried, and failed, to resuscitate a young woman whose heart had stopped. All shared one thing, says Denson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the Tulane University School of Medicine. “They are all COVID positive.”</p><p>As the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 surges past 2.2 million globally and deaths surpass 150,000, clinicians and pathologists are struggling to understand the damage wrought by the coronavirus as it tears through the body. They are realizing that although the lungs are ground zero, its reach can extend to many organs including the heart and blood vessels, kidneys, gut, and brain.</p><p>“[The disease] can attack almost anything in the body with devastating consequences,” says cardiologist Harlan Krumholz of Yale University and Yale-New Haven Hospital, who is leading multiple efforts to gather clinical data on COVID-19. “Its ferocity is breathtaking and humbling.”</p><p>Understanding the rampage could help the doctors on the front lines treat the fraction of infected people who become desperately and sometimes mysteriously ill. Does a dangerous, newly observed tendency to blood clotting transform some mild cases into life-threatening emergencies? Is an overzealous immune response behind the worst cases, suggesting treatment with immune-suppressing drugs could help? What explains the startlingly low blood oxygen that some physicians are reporting in patients who nonetheless are not gasping for breath? “Taking a systems approach may be beneficial as we start thinking about therapies,” says Nilam Mangalmurti, a pulmonary intensivist at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP).</p><p>What follows is a snapshot of the fast-evolving understanding of how the virus attacks cells around the body, especially in the roughly 5% of patients who become critically ill. Despite the more than 1000 papers now spilling into journals and onto preprint servers every week, a clear picture is elusive, as the virus acts like no pathogen humanity has ever seen. Without larger, prospective controlled studies that are only now being launched, scientists must pull information from small studies and case reports, often published at warp speed and not yet peer reviewed. “We need to keep a very open mind as this phenomenon goes forward,” says Nancy Reau, a liver transplant physician who has been treating COVID-19 patients at Rush University Medical Center. “We are still learning.”</p><p>When an infected person expels virus-laden droplets and someone else inhales them, the novel coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, enters the nose and throat. It finds a welcome home in the lining of the nose, according to a preprint from scientists at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and elsewhere. They found that cells there are rich in a cell-surface receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Throughout the body, the presence of ACE2, which normally helps regulate blood pressure, marks tissues vulnerable to infection, because the virus requires that receptor to enter a cell. Once inside, the virus hijacks the cell’s machinery, making myriad copies of itself and invading new cells.</p><p>As the virus multiplies, an infected person may shed copious amounts of it, especially during the first week or so. Symptoms may be absent at this point. Or the virus’ new victim may develop a fever, dry cough, sore throat, loss of smell and taste, or head and body aches.</p><p>If the immune system doesn’t beat back SARS-CoV-2 during this initial phase, the virus then marches down the windpipe to attack the lungs, where it can turn deadly. The thinner, distant branches of the lung’s respiratory tree end in tiny air sacs called alveoli, each lined by a single layer of cells that are also rich in ACE2 receptors.</p><p>Normally, oxygen crosses the alveoli into the capillaries, tiny blood vessels that lie beside the air sacs; the oxygen is then carried to the rest of the body. But as the immune system wars with the invader, the battle itself disrupts this healthy oxygen transfer. Front-line white blood cells release inflammatory molecules called chemokines, which in turn summon more immune cells that target and kill virus-infected cells, leaving a stew of fluid and dead cells—pus—behind. This is the underlying pathology of pneumonia, with its corresponding symptoms: coughing; fever; and rapid, shallow respiration (see graphic). Some COVID-19 patients recover, sometimes with no more support than oxygen breathed in through nasal prongs.</p><p>But others deteriorate, often quite suddenly, developing a condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Oxygen levels in their blood plummet and they struggle ever harder to breathe. On x-rays and computed tomography scans, their lungs are riddled with white opacities where black space—air—should be. Commonly, these patients end up on ventilators. Many die. Autopsies show their alveoli became stuffed with fluid, white blood cells, mucus, and the detritus of destroyed lung cells.</p><p>Some clinicians suspect the driving force in many gravely ill patients’ downhill trajectories is a disastrous overreaction of the immune system known as a “cytokine storm,” which other viral infections are known to trigger. Cytokines are chemical signaling molecules that guide a healthy immune response; but in a cytokine storm, levels of certain cytokines soar far beyond what’s needed, and immune cells start to attack healthy tissues. Blood vessels leak, blood pressure drops, clots form, and catastrophic organ failure can ensue.</p><p>Some studies have shown elevated levels of these inflammation-inducing cytokines in the blood of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. “The real morbidity and mortality of this disease is probably driven by this out of proportion inflammatory response to the virus,” says Jamie Garfield, a pulmonologist who cares for COVID-19 patients at Temple University Hospital.</p><p>But others aren’t convinced. “There seems to have been a quick move to associate COVID-19 with these hyperinflammatory states. I haven’t really seen convincing data that that is the case,” says Joseph Levitt, a pulmonary critical care physician at the Stanford University School of Medicine.</p><p>He’s also worried that efforts to dampen a cytokine response could backfire. Several drugs targeting specific cytokines are in clinical trials in COVID-19 patients. But Levitt fears those drugs may suppress the immune response that the body needs to fight off the virus. “There’s a real risk that we allow more viral replication,” Levitt says.</p><p>Meanwhile, other scientists are zeroing in on an entirely different organ system that they say is driving some patients’ rapid deterioration: the heart and blood vessels.</p><p>In Brescia, Italy, a 53-year-old woman walked into the emergency room of her local hospital with all the classic symptoms of a heart attack, including telltale signs in her electrocardiogram and high levels of a blood marker suggesting damaged cardiac muscles. Further tests showed cardiac swelling and scarring, and a left ventricle—normally the powerhouse chamber of the heart—so weak that it could only pump one-third its normal amount of blood. But when doctors injected dye in the coronary arteries, looking for the blockage that signifies a heart attack, they found none. Another test revealed why: The woman had COVID-19.</p><p>How the virus attacks the heart and blood vessels is a mystery, but dozens of preprints and papers attest that such damage is common. A 25 March paper in JAMA Cardiology documented heart damage in nearly 20% of patients out of 416 hospitalized for COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. In another Wuhan study, 44% of 36 patients admitted to the ICU had arrhythmias.</p><p>The disruption seems to extend to the blood itself. Among 184 COVID-19 patients in a Dutch ICU, 38% had blood that clotted abnormally, and almost one-third already had clots, according to a 10 April paper in Thrombosis Research. Blood clots can break apart and land in the lungs, blocking vital arteries—a condition known as pulmonary embolism, which has reportedly killed COVID-19 patients. Clots from arteries can also lodge in the brain, causing stroke. Many patients have “dramatically” high levels of D-dimer, a byproduct of blood clots, says Behnood Bikdeli, a cardiovascular medicine fellow at Columbia University Medical Center.</p><p>“The more we look, the more likely it becomes that blood clots are a major player in the disease severity and mortality from COVID-19,” Bikdeli says.</p><p>Infection may also lead to blood vessel constriction. Reports are emerging of ischemia in the fingers and toes—a reduction in blood flow that can lead to swollen, painful digits and tissue death.</p><p>In the lungs, blood vessel constriction might help explain anecdotal reports of a perplexing phenomenon seen in pneumonia caused by COVID-19: Some patients have extremely low blood-oxygen levels and yet are not gasping for breath. It’s possible that at some stages of disease, the virus alters the delicate balance of hormones that help regulate blood pressure and constricts blood vessels going to the lungs. So oxygen uptake is impeded by constricted blood vessels, rather than by clogged alveoli. “One theory is that the virus affects the vascular biology and that’s why we see these really low oxygen levels,” Levitt says.</p><p>If COVID-19 targets blood vessels, that could also help explain why patients with pre-existing damage to those vessels, for example from diabetes and high blood pressure, face higher risk of serious disease. Recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data on hospitalized patients in 14 U.S. states found that about one-third had chronic lung disease—but nearly as many had diabetes, and fully half had pre-existing high blood pressure.</p><p>Mangalmurti says she has been “shocked by the fact that we don’t have a huge number of asthmatics” or patients with other respiratory diseases in HUP’s ICU. “It’s very striking to us that risk factors seem to be vascular: diabetes, obesity, age, hypertension.”</p><p>Scientists are struggling to understand exactly what causes the cardiovascular damage. The virus may directly attack the lining of the heart and blood vessels, which, like the nose and alveoli, are rich in ACE2 receptors. Or perhaps lack of oxygen, due to the chaos in the lungs, damages blood vessels. Or a cytokine storm could ravage the heart as it does other organs.</p><p>“We’re still at the beginning,” Krumholz says. “We really don’t understand who is vulnerable, why some people are affected so severely, why it comes on so rapidly … and why it is so hard [for some] to recover.”</p><p>The worldwide fears of ventilator shortages for failing lungs have received plenty of attention. Not so a scramble for another type of equipment: dialysis machines. “If these folks are not dying of lung failure, they’re dying of renal failure,” says neurologist Jennifer Frontera of New York University’s Langone Medical Center, which has treated thousands of COVID-19 patients. Her hospital is developing a dialysis protocol with different machines to support additional patients. The need for dialysis may be because the kidneys, abundantly endowed with ACE2 receptors, present another viral target.</p><p>According to one preprint, 27% of 85 hospitalized patients in Wuhan had kidney failure. Another reported that 59% of nearly 200 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China’s Hubei and Sichuan provinces had protein in their urine, and 44% had blood; both suggest kidney damage. Those with acute kidney injury (AKI), were more than five times as likely to die as COVID-19 patients without it, the same Chinese preprint reported.</p><p>“The lung is the primary battle zone. But a fraction of the virus possibly attacks the kidney. And as on the real battlefield, if two places are being attacked at the same time, each place gets worse,” says Hongbo Jia, a neuroscientist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’s Suzhou Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Technology and a co-author of that study.</p><p>Viral particles were identified in electron micrographs of kidneys from autopsies in one study, suggesting a direct viral attack. But kidney injury may also be collateral damage. Ventilators boost the risk of kidney damage, as do antiviral compounds including remdesivir, which is being deployed experimentally in COVID-19 patients. Cytokine storms also can dramatically reduce blood flow to the kidney, causing often-fatal damage. And pre-existing diseases like diabetes can increase the chances of kidney injury. “There is a whole bucket of people who already have some chronic kidney disease who are at higher risk for acute kidney injury,” says Suzanne Watnick, chief medical officer at Northwest Kidney Centers.</p><p>Another striking set of symptoms in COVID-19 patients centers on the brain and central nervous system. Frontera says neurologists are needed to assess 5% to 10% of coronavirus patients at her hospital. But she says that “is probably a gross underestimate” of the number whose brains are struggling, especially because many are sedated and on ventilators.</p><p>Frontera has seen patients with the brain inflammation encephalitis, with seizures, and with a “sympathetic storm,” a hyperreaction of the sympathetic nervous system that causes seizurelike symptoms and is most common after a traumatic brain injury. Some people with COVID-19 briefly lose consciousness. Others have strokes. Many report losing their sense of smell. And Frontera and others wonder whether in some cases, infection depresses the brain stem reflex that senses oxygen starvation. This is another explanation for anecdotal observations that some patients aren’t gasping for air, despite dangerously low blood oxygen levels.</p><p>ACE2 receptors are present in the neural cortex and brain stem, says Robert Stevens, an intensive care physician at Johns Hopkins Medicine. But it’s not known under what circumstances the virus penetrates the brain and interacts with these receptors. That said, the coronavirus behind the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic—a close cousin of today’s culprit—could infiltrate neurons and sometimes caused encephalitis. On 3 April, a case study in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases, from a team in Japan, reported traces of new coronavirus in the cerebrospinal fluid of a COVID-19 patient who developed meningitis and encephalitis, suggesting it, too, can penetrate the central nervous system.</p><p>But other factors could be damaging the brain. For example, a cytokine storm could cause brain swelling, and the blood’s exaggerated tendency to clot could trigger strokes. The challenge now is to shift from conjecture to confidence, at a time when staff are focused on saving lives, and even neurologic assessments like inducing the gag reflex or transporting patients for brain scans risk spreading the virus.</p><p>Last month, Sherry Chou, a neurologist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, began to organize a worldwide consortium that now includes 50 centers to draw neurological data from care patients already receive. The early goals are simple: Identify the prevalence of neurologic complications in hospitalized patients and document how they fare. Longer term, Chou and her colleagues hope to gather scans, lab tests, and other data to better understand the virus’ impact on the nervous system, including the brain.</p><p>Chou speculates about a possible invasion route: through the nose, then upward and through the olfactory bulb—explaining reports of a loss of smell—which connects to the brain. “It’s a nice sounding theory,” she says. “We really have to go and prove that.”</p><p>Most neurological symptoms “are reported from colleague to colleague by word of mouth,” Chou adds. “I don’t think anybody, and certainly not me, can say we’re experts.”</p><p>In early March, a 71-year-old Michigan woman returned from a Nile River cruise with bloody diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Initially doctors suspected she had a common stomach bug, such as Salmonella. But after she developed a cough, doctors took a nasal swab and found her positive for the novel coronavirus. A stool sample positive for viral RNA, as well as signs of colon injury seen in an endoscopy, pointed to a gastrointestinal (GI) infection with the coronavirus, according to a paper posted online in The American Journal of Gastroenterology (AJG).</p><p>Her case adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting the new coronavirus, like its cousin SARS, can infect the lining of the lower digestive tract, where the crucial ACE2 receptors are abundant. Viral RNA has been found in as many as 53% of sampled patients’ stool samples. And in a paper in press at Gastroenterology, a Chinese team reported finding the virus’ protein shell in gastric, duodenal, and rectal cells in biopsies from a COVID-19 patient. “I think it probably does replicate in the gastrointestinal tract,” says Mary Estes, a virologist at Baylor College of Medicine.</p><p>Recent reports suggest up to half of patients, averaging about 20% across studies, experience diarrhea, says Brennan Spiegel of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, co–editor-in-chief of AJG. GI symptoms aren’t on CDC’s list of COVID-19 symptoms, which could cause some COVID-19 cases to go undetected, Spiegel and others say. “If you mainly have fever and diarrhea, you won’t be tested for COVID,” says Douglas Corley of Kaiser Permanente, Northern California, co-editor of Gastroenterology.</p><p>The presence of virus in the GI tract raises the unsettling possibility that it could be passed on through feces. But it’s not yet clear whether stool contains intact, infectious virus, or only RNA and proteins. To date, “We have no evidence” that fecal transmission is important, says coronavirus expert Stanley Perlman of the University of Iowa. CDC says that based on experiences with SARS and with the virus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome, another dangerous cousin of the new coronavirus, the risk from fecal transmission is probably low.</p><p>The intestines are not the end of the disease’s march through the body. For example, up to one-third of hospitalized patients develop conjunctivitis—pink, watery eyes—although it’s not clear that the virus directly invades the eye. Other reports suggest liver damage: More than half of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in two Chinese centers had elevated levels of enzymes indicating injury to the liver or bile ducts. But several experts told Science that direct viral invasion isn’t likely the culprit. They say other events in a failing body, like drugs or an immune system in overdrive, are more likely driving the liver damage.</p><p>This map of the devastation that COVID-19 can inflict on the body is still just a sketch. It will take years of painstaking research to sharpen the picture of its reach, and the cascade of cardiovascular and immune effects it might set in motion. As science races ahead, from probing tissues under microscopes to testing drugs on patients, the hope is for treatments more wily than the virus that has stopped the world in its tracks.</p><p>*Correction, 20 April, 12:25 p.m.: This story has been updated to correct the description of a sympathetic storm.

Causing wheat scab—also known as head blight—it decimates harvests and contaminates grains with a toxin harmful to people and animals. Now, Australian researchers have come up with a new strategy to combat Fusarium graminearum, the most notorious wheat scab pathogen. In the lab, they have used a genome-altering technology called “gene drive” to get rid of the fungal genes that make this pest so toxic.</p><p>The new wheat strategy would be the first use of a gene drive to control a pathogen in plants. The findings are “very enticing” for both plant and human health, says John Leslie, a fungal pathologist at Kansas State University. Yet gene drives have never been deployed outside of the lab and plans to use them to eliminate mosquitoes and other pests have been controversial.</p><p>Wheat scab is a growing problem in North America, Europe, and China. Researchers are scrambling to breed wheat resistant to this fungus, with some recent success. Even so, “Disease management is reaching a crossroads,” says Peter Solomon, a molecular plant pathologist at the Australian National University.</p><p>It takes a lot of time and effort to develop new breeds of wheat. And producing significant resistance to this fungus will likely require introducing multiple genes. Even then, complete protection may not be achieved. Meanwhile, the fungus rapidly becomes resistant to any chemical treatments, and various countries are beginning to ban the use of these fungicides. For those reasons, Solomon says, “It’s important that we don’t shy away from considering new and novel methods for managing diseases.”</p><p>So Donald Gardiner, a molecular biologist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in St. Lucia, Australia, and his colleagues decided to see whether they could make Fusarium less potent by using gene drive. The process involves introducing DNA into an organism that causes one version of a gene to be passed on to the next generation but not another. Eventually, just the desired versions of those genes remain in the population.</p><p>Scientists typically use the gene editing tool CRISPR as the gene driver. That’s how researchers hope to fight malaria: They adapted CRISPR to spread a gene that transformed populations of a malaria-transmitting mosquito into all males so the species cannot reproduce. Given the many uncertainties about the long-term consequences of releasing a gene drive, scientists are proceeding cautiously with such work.</p><p>Although aware of those concerns, Gardiner and his colleagues still felt a gene drive was worth exploring for wheat scab. Their intent was to get rid of three Fusarium genes that make the pathogen highly infectious and the infected grains toxic, all while leaving the fungus otherwise intact DNA-wise.</p><p>They found that CRISPR did not efficiently spread the innocuous versions of these genes. But a gene in another fungus—what Gardiner calls a natural gene drive—proved up to the task, being more efficient than CRISPR and easier to work with.</p><p>Gardiner and colleagues linked that gene to innocuous versions of the three targeted genes. Once in the Fusarium, the gene-drive gene caused any sexually produced spores that wound up with the original versions of targeted genes to die. Thus, the innocuous versions were preferentially transferred to the next generation. Those subsequent generations were less able to cause wheat scab but otherwise were no different from the typical Fusarium, the team reports in a preprint posted this month to bioRxiv.</p><p>“It’s a bit like replacing a couple of sentences in the middle of a large book with some unrelated text,” Gardiner says. In just three generations, the three virulent genes were completely gone, he and his colleagues report. “We think the technology should be applicable to many other economically important pathogens,” Gardiner says.</p><p>Others are skeptical. “It’s a new idea, but not practical,” says Caixia Gao, a plant biologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. She doesn’t think any Fusarium deprived of its virulence genes could survive in the wild and outcompete unaltered versions of the fungus or other Fusarium species. “The consequences will be that other pathogens may dominate,” she says, and the disease would still be a problem.</p><p>And Leslie stresses that many fungi, including some types of Fusarium, rarely or never reproduce sexually, which is a prerequisite for a gene-drive control mechanism to work. Furthermore, “Developing field tests will be very important and probably difficult to design,” he adds. The team will have to show the gene drive is effective in reducing wheat scab under natural conditions, Leslie says, and at the same time make sure that the modified fungus doesn’t escape into the wild. Even if the logistical issues can be worked out, getting regulatory approval to release a genetically engineered plant pathogenic fungus will be hard.</p><p>Yet, “The concept is worth exploring” Leslie says. “Even if it fails, we should learn a great deal about how to manage fungal populations.”</p>\",\"date\":\"Apr. 22, 2020\",\"link\":\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/controversial-gene-drive-could-disarm-deadly-wheat-pathogen\",\"discrp\":\"\\n      Controversial ‘gene drive’ could disarm deadly wheat pathogen      \\n  \\n      Lab tests show potential of gene-spreading strategy to fight plant diseases  \\n\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","{\"content\":\"<p>Viruses might not be alive, but they may be altering life on a global scale. Researchers have found that a bizarre group of microbes known as “giant viruses” contain genes associated with metabolism, which they likely use to convert their zombified hosts into supercharged energy factories. Because many of their victims are important players in dampening climate change and in controlling ocean ecosystems, the megaviruses may be exerting an unexpected power over life on Earth.</p><p>There are more than 200,000 kinds of viruses in the world’s oceans. Some are giant viruses, so named because they tend to be about 10 times bigger than the average virus. They’re still tiny—the largest is only one-fifth the size of a red blood cell—which may explain why they went undiscovered until 2003. Since then, researchers have learned some basic facts—the viruses mostly infect amoebas and phytoplankton, for example—but scientists are still trying to figure out what makes them tick.</p><p>In the new study, microbiologists led by Frank Aylward of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University didn’t scour the oceans. Instead, they went hunting in public databases, scanning thousands of mostly marine genomes for the DNA fingerprints of giant viruses.</p><p>They extracted 501 suspected giant virus genomes, mapping them against 121 known reference genomes to create a family tree. Their results, published this month in Nature Communications, show that giant viruses are extremely diverse, splitting into 54 distinct groups. Several genomes were new to science and likely represent new species.</p><p>In addition to the usual genes that allow a virus to infect its host and multiply, many also contained genes for metabolism, the process that converts food into energy in all living cells. This was a surprise because viruses don’t eat. And strangely, these genes weren’t a recent addition, says first author Mohammad “Monir” Moniruzzaman: Many had been evolving in the viruses for millions of years. “If your goal is simply to find a new host and multiply,” he asks, why do you need these genes?</p><p>All of this could have a dramatic impact on sea life. Phytoplankton suck the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they photosynthesize. They also form the base of the entire food web, the interconnected “who-eats-whom” relationships between predator and prey. Still, researchers are just beginning to study what the larger impacts could be.</p><p>Frederik Schulz, a microbiologist at the Joint Genome Institute, says the new work comes to “similar conclusions” as those found by his own team. But he cautions against speculating too broadly. Just because a gene helps living organisms metabolize, doesn’t mean it does the same thing for viruses.</p><p>Both groups agree that cultivating giant viruses in the laboratory would allow researchers to see what these genes really do. “As much as I can tell lots of stories,” Moniruzzaman says, “you really need to verify them in the lab.”</p>\",\"date\":\"Apr. 22, 2020\",\"link\":\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/giant-viruses-aren-t-alive-so-why-have-they-stolen-genes-essential-life\",\"discrp\":\"\\n      Giant viruses aren’t alive.

Her crowd of friends matched the profile she had seen in TV dramas—overachievers who exercised regularly and whose eating was erratic, hours of fasting followed by “a huge pizza.”</p><p>“My friends and I should have had eating disorders,” she says. “And we didn’t.”</p><p>It was an early clue that her understanding of eating disorders was off the mark, especially for the direst diagnosis of all: anorexia nervosa. Anorexia is estimated to affect just under 1% of the U.S. population, with many more who may go undiagnosed. The illness manifests as self-starvation and weight loss so extreme that it can send the body into a state resembling hibernation. Although the disorder also affects boys and men, those who have it are most often female, and about 10% of those affected die. That’s the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric condition after substance abuse, on par with that of childhood leukemia. With current treatments, about half of adolescents recover, and another 20% to 30% are helped.\\n</p><p>As a young adult, Timko shared the prevailing view of the disease: that it develops when girls, motivated by a culture that worships thinness, exert extreme willpower to stop themselves from eating. Often, the idea went, the behavior arises in reaction to parents who are unloving, controlling, or worse. But when Timko began to treat teens with anorexia and their families, that narrative crumbled—and so did her certainties about who is at risk. Many of those young people “don’t have body dissatisfaction, they weren’t on a diet, it’s not about control,” she found. “Their mom and dad are fabulous and would move heaven and Earth to get them better.”</p><p>Timko wasn’t alone. Other researchers were also questioning psychological theories of anorexia that had reigned for generations. “Hunger is a basic drive,” says Cynthia Bulik, a clinical psychologist who runs eating disorder centers at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and at the Karolinska Institute. The idea that patients use willpower to override hunger “never rang true,” she says. “My patients have said for years that … when they starve, they feel better.” She began to consider another possibility: What if their biology is driving them to eschew food?</p><p>Bulik and Timko are now part of a small band of researchers working to untangle the biology of anorexia. The more they look, the more they find to suggest the disease’s biological roots run deep. For instance, genetic studies indicate it’s about as heritable as obesity or depression. The circuitry of the brain’s reward system behaves differently in unaffected volunteers than in people with anorexia and those who have recovered. And new treatments drawing on biology are being tested, including deep-brain stimulation and psychedelic drugs. Those experiments aim not only to improve the outlook for patients, but also to explore how closely the disease aligns with others across psychiatry, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and addiction.</p><p>Scientists pursuing those new ideas face a challenge, in part because of money: For fiscal year 2019, anorexia got $11 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a figure that hasn’t changed notably in many years and that researchers decry as shockingly low given the disease’s burdens. By contrast, schizophrenia—which has a similar prevalence and also surges during adolescence—garnered $263 million. The dearth of funder interest, many say, springs from the view that anorexia’s roots are cultural, along with shame and stigma still clouding the disease. But evidence is mounting that biology is at its core.</p><p>LORI ZELTSER PIVOTED to anorexia from studying obesity. A developmental neuroscientist at Columbia University, she studied the brains of developing mice, trying to identify feeding circuits that increase susceptibility to obesity in adulthood. Then about 10 years ago, Zeltser saw a notice for funding from the Klarman Family Foundation, formed by hedge fund manager Seth Klarman and his wife, Beth, now the foundation’s president. The foundation wanted to stimulate basic research into eating disorders, and because of Zeltser’s research on appetite, she submitted a proposal.</p><p>To get up to speed on anorexia, Zeltser turned to the literature. Researchers in Sweden and Minnesota had compared anorexia rates in identical and fraternal twins, a common approach to tease out heritability of complex traits and diseases. Those reports showed that 50% to 60% of the risk of developing anorexia was due to genes, implying DNA is a powerful driver. By contrast, family studies suggest the heritability of breast cancer is about 30%, and that of depression is roughly 40%. “I was shocked,” Zeltser says.</p><p>Layered on the genetics work was a data point that caught Zeltser’s attention. An antipsychotic drug, olanzapine, which causes profound weight gain as a side effect, had little to no effect on weight when tested in people with anorexia. Something in people’s biology prevented olanzapine from causing weight gain, Zeltser believes. “That is not just [mental] control.”</p><p>But a deep schism remains, with many practitioners concerned that biology is getting more attention than it deserves. “If I had to choose nature versus nurture in the development of anorexia and other eating disorders, I would choose nurture,” says Margo Maine, a psychologist who has treated eating disorders for years. Eating disorders are primarily female, she says, in part because “gender is a cultural experience.”</p><p>Psychotherapist Carolyn Costin, who recovered from anorexia in the late 1970s and established a network of private treatment centers around the United States, says biology plays a role but that cultural messages and psychological stressors are also important factors. She worries especially that the way biology research is described could discourage patients about their prospects for recovery. About 8 years ago, she says, “Clients started coming in, saying, ‘It’s genetic, why bother’” trying to get well?</p><p>Such comments agitate researchers like Bulik. The patients she treats, she says, are reassured, not distressed, to learn that the disorder is rooted in biology and that biology doesn’t translate into destiny. Although she, Zeltser, and others agree that anorexia has environmental drivers, as most chronic conditions do, they object to the idea that environment leads the way. “Exposure to this ideal [of thinness] is ubiquitous, but everybody doesn’t get anorexia nervosa,” Bulik says. “None of the sociocultural literature has ever been able to explain why.” She adds, “A lot of patients will say, ‘It was never about being thin for me, ever.’”</p><p>“If you look at psychiatric syndromes over 200 years, anorexia hasn’t changed at all,” whereas our culture has, says James Lock, a child psychiatrist who heads the child and adolescent eating disorders program at Stanford University School of Medicine.</p><p>To begin digging into the biology of anorexia, Zeltser used a 2010 grant from the Klarman foundation to build a mouse model of the disease. Because feeding is easy to measure, she reasoned that anorexia’s restrained feeding behavior is well-suited for animal modeling. Her goal was to study the eating and starvation patterns of the mice and explore how genetics and the environment interact to trigger the disorder.</p><p>In a 2016 issue of Translational Psychiatry, Zeltser described mice with a variant in a gene that in people is linked to anorexia. On its own, the variant didn’t noticeably affect mouse feeding behavior. To mimic the pullback from eating that often precedes a diagnosis, the researchers restricted the animals’ caloric intake by 20% to 30%. Then they induced stress, another factor linked to anorexia, by housing the normally social animals alone. The result: “The mice stop eating,” Zeltser says.</p><p>Zeltser is talking with clinical colleagues about comparing her rodents’ behavior with videos of patients in a “feeding lab,” where researchers observe how much people eat, which nutrients they choose, and which they avoid. If the behaviors seem parallel, the mice could help point the way to new treatments or even different environments that could better support eating.</p><p>But publishing her animal work has proved difficult. Zeltser is often asked, “How do you know if what you’re finding is relevant to humans?” That’s a common question of anyone doing mouse work, but Zeltser says the challenge here runs deeper. “This is not taken seriously as a disease” that has a biological basis, she says. Instead, it’s dismissed as “extreme girl behavior and ‘oh my God, they’re crazy,’” pushback she finds immensely frustrating.</p><p>Accumulating genetic data could change that by making anorexia’s biological roots harder to ignore. Some of the strongest evidence emerged last summer, when Bulik and others published in Nature Genetics the largest genetics study on the disease, with roughly $9 million in funding from the Klarman foundation and additional funds from NIH. By analyzing the genomes of nearly 17,000 people with anorexia and more than 55,000 people without, the researchers identified eight statistically significant genomic regions, along with other patterns of genetic associations that yielded important clues. Some of those associations tracked with results of studies of other psychiatric illnesses, including OCD and depression, which didn’t surprise Bulik. What did were overlapping associations with DNA controlling body mass index (BMI), lipids, and other metabolic traits.</p><p>“We said, ‘This doesn’t look like any other psychiatric disorder,’” Bulik says. “It might be the inverse of obesity—these people might be genetically predisposed to low BMI.” In the February 2019 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, she and her team sifted through BMI records for young people later diagnosed with anorexia and other eating disorders. The BMIs of 243 people diagnosed with anorexia began to diverge from those of a control group before they started kindergarten.</p><p>Bulik is now launching the Eating Disorders Genetics Initiative, with more than $7 million from NIH, additional funding from Sweden and the United Kingdom, and potential infusions from other countries and individual donors. The initiative aims to include 100,000 people with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. Although genetics is unlikely to offer quick solutions, Bulik hopes it can “shine the light in the direction you need to go” for effective therapies, including medications.</p><p>THE GENETIC FINDINGS might one day intersect with another line of research: studies of brain structures and signaling that are revealing tantalizing differences between people with and without anorexia. At Columbia, psychiatrist Joanna Steinglass wanted to understand how the brains of people with anorexia guide their food choices. In two studies, she and her colleagues recruited inpatients with eating disorders along with a control group. In people with anorexia, both during and after hospitalization, MRI scans showed the region of the brain associated with selecting foods was the dorsal striatum, which is key to forming habits. In people without an eating disorder, a different brain region guides choices. The work first appeared in 2015 in Nature Neuroscience, and the team presented more findings at a conference last year.</p><p>“They’re using different circuits when they make decisions,” Steinglass says. This jibes with her idea that as people repeatedly restrict eating, the behavior moves to a different brain region and becomes less amenable to change. That could help explain why many recovered patients relapse.</p><p>Another clue to how the brain might throw eating off track was reported last month in The American Journal of Psychiatry. Walter Kaye, a psychiatrist who directs the eating disorders program at the University of California (UC), San Diego, led a study looking at how the brains of people with anorexia behave when their bodies are hungry. Kaye, whose program treats about 70 patients per day, ran a study that included 48 women, 26 of whom had anorexia. Each was studied twice with brain imaging, once immediately after a meal and, on a separate visit, after fasting for 16 hours.</p><p>Kaye knew hunger activates brain circuits that in turn motivate eating, making food desirable. That relationship was clear during brain imaging of the control group volunteers: When they were offered sugar water after 16 hours of fasting, their reward and motivation circuits lit up. But in people with anorexia, those circuits were much less active after fasting. “They could identify being hungry,” Kaye says, but their brains couldn’t convert that into a desire to eat. The patients also experienced heightened anxiety and inhibition, along with diminished reward signaling in their brains. That effect may further impair their drive to eat. Kaye suggests people with anorexia “miscode food as risky rather than rewarding.”</p><p>Psychiatrist Rebecca Park at the University of Oxford also suspects the disease hijacks the brain’s reward system. Some of her patients experience “this sense of aberrant reward,” almost a high from starvation, she says. Park’s neuroscience research indicates aberrant brain responses to reward cues.</p><p>Are those brain differences a cause or a result of starvation? Studying people in remission eliminates the effects of malnutrition on the brain but can’t definitively answer the question. It’s likely that “starvation in adolescence is going to damage your brain,” Park says. One way to begin to disentangle whether the brain differences predate the disease is to study people very early in its course. Steinglass is in the third year of a brain scanning study of reward circuitry, which now includes 55 recently diagnosed teenagers and a control group of 25 others. The coronavirus pandemic has halted enrollment for now, but Steinglass hopes to have results in 2 to 3 years. Other researchers are working to understand how, and to what degree, the brain recovers once eating resumes.</p><p>THERE’S AN “OVERALL SENSE that we’re joining the rest of the world” by finally applying scientific methods to anorexia nervosa, Steinglass says. The ultimate goal is new treatments, which are sorely needed.</p><p>The most studied and most effective strategy to date is called family-based treatment (FBT), which originated at the Maudsley Hospital in London. It was later refined by Lock and psychologist Daniel Le Grange, of UC San Francisco, who trained at Maudsley.</p><p>FBT asks parents to set aside many of their family’s day-to-day activities—scaling back school, work, hobbies—to sit with their children, requiring them to eat. Faced with food as a form of medicine, and with their world having contracted, many young people do start to eat again despite the fear and anxiety it causes them. Researchers are working to understand how FBT is intertwined with the biology of the illness, but for about half who try FBT in adolescence—and perhaps 70% who try it early in the disease—the treatment is effective.</p><p>But many families aren’t told about that therapeutic strategy, even though decades have passed since it first showed success in a randomized trial, in 1987. Practitioners may not be familiar with FBT, Timko says, they may believe the family played a role in anorexia’s onset, or they may feel that adolescents must want to get better before starting FBT—a view she disputes.</p><p>Laura Collins Lyster-Mensh experienced the regimen up close after her daughter Olympia, then 14, stopped eating one day in 2002. Lyster-Mensh says a succession of therapists urged her and her husband to stand back and let Olympia eat when she was ready. Meanwhile, her weight continued to spiral downward. “We had been told she wouldn’t recover, families were really at fault, to back off and let her do this on her own,” Lyster-Mensh says. Then she learned about FBT from a newspaper article and raced to try it.</p><p>The first agonizing meals took hours, while Olympia mashed her food into a pulp or cried and raged at her parents. “I know families whose kids have jumped out of moving cars to avoid a sandwich,” says Lyster-Mensh, echoing comments of many clinicians who describe patients’ crushing fear of food. Olympia ultimately recovered, although not without challenges that included a relapse during college.</p><p>The young patients treated with FBT who do start to eat again do well on the one measure that predicts longer-term prognosis: early weight gain. In 2019, a study in the European Eating Disorders Review led by Le Grange confirmed earlier research showing that gaining about 2.3 kilograms in the first month of treatment is a predictor of health 1 year later. Girls with anorexia who boosted their calorie intake and gained weight experienced increases in estrogen levels (which plummet in starvation), reduced stress, and improved ability to navigate different situations, a psychological trait called flexibility.</p><p>Researchers are exploring ways to build on and improve FBT—or find new strategies to help patients in whom it has failed. Some clinical trials are testing whether certain talk therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy to help patients reframe their thinking, can help—for example, by reducing anxiety or other impediments to eating.</p><p>New biological models of anorexia hint at other kinds of interventions. An 18-person study at Johns Hopkins University is offering the psychedelic drug psilocybin to patients. Early data suggest it holds promise in helping smokers quit and combating alcoholism—and many researchers believe that in certain ways, anorexia shares some features with addiction. Park is leading a seven-person study of deep-brain stimulation in people with severe enduring anorexia, some of whom also have OCD.</p><p>“There’s a certain neural network that’s well characterized” in OCD, she says, and disrupting the signaling in that network with deep-brain stimulation can help those patients. Because OCD and anorexia have shared features and some genetic links, she’s interested in whether disrupting the same neural network might also help people with the eating disorder.</p><p>Still, studies remain sparse, Lock says. With limited funding, there’s little chance of attracting new scientists to a small field. “As researchers, you don’t want to go to the pot that’s empty,” he says. “Why aren’t we investing more?” It’s especially frustrating because, Lock points out, many patients with anorexia successfully heal and enjoy a bright future. “What [other] illness in psychiatry can you say you cure?” he asks.</p><p>For families, regardless of whether a patient recovers, the shame can persist—and with it hesitation to speak up and lobby for funding. Lyster-Mensh is an exception. After her family’s experience, she began to voice support for evidence-based treatment—first in a memoir, Eating with Your Anorexic, which she wrote under the name Laura Collins, and then through FEAST, a message board turned advocacy group.</p><p>“It’s still a pretty small group,” Lyster-Mensh says, of those willing to speak openly. “Most families are so burned out, crushed, guilty, that they don’t want to come forward,” she says. “There are still these myths out there—that these are chosen illnesses and parents somehow failed to prevent, or caused, or exacerbated the problem.” Still, she hopes that as researchers doggedly track the disease’s biological roots in genes and the brain, those enduring myths will fade.</p>\",\"date\":\"Apr. 22, 2020\",\"link\":\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/rethinking-anorexia-biology-may-be-more-important-culture-new-studies-reveal\",\"discrp\":\"\\n      Rethinking anorexia: Biology may be more important than culture, new studies reveal      \\n  \\n      Genetics and brain biology may shed light on anorexia’s beginnings and how to improve treatment  \\n\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","{\"content\":\"<p>Microbes are everywhere in our guts—and in our mouths.

The 90 patients in the study receive the usual treatments for heart disease, such as small tubes called stents to prop open their narrowed arteries. But half of the patients in the phase II trial, conducted by clinical pharmacologist Albert Ferro of King’s College London and colleagues, also pop pills targeting a class of immune cells called neutrophils. Researchers think that by invading the fatty obstructions, or plaques, in clogged arteries, neutrophils make them even more dangerous. The drug is designed to steer the cells away.</p><p>Interfering with neutrophils is an audacious idea. Neutrophils make up some 70% of the white cells in blood, with billions spawned every day by stem cells nestled in the bone marrow. The cells patrol the bloodstream and wage war on pathogens, and their defensive role is so vital that people who lose their neutrophils in the course of cancer treatment can die from infections.</p><p>But their scorched-earth tactics are tough on the body. “They are the classic double-edged sword,” says immunologist Michael Fessler of the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. For example, the enzyme neutrophil elastase, which neutrophils release to kill invading bacteria, also erodes the extracellular matrix, the mesh of proteins and sugars that cradles cells and provides structural support for tissue.</p><p>Neutrophils can also malfunction. In some conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), they seem to lose their sense of direction: Instead of homing in on bacteria, they wander. Researchers suspect these vagrant neutrophils release neutrophil elastase and other molecules at the wrong spots, including the lungs, causing the tissue damage seen in COPD. And as people age, neutrophils become less effective at combating infections and more harmful to the body.</p><p>“We are now beginning to understand that neutrophils are linked to many diseases that blight our population,” says pulmonologist Elizabeth Sapey of the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom. With that realization has come optimism that these cells aren’t off-limits for medical interventions. Researchers have been cautious about targeting neutrophils, fearing that doing so would leave patients at the mercy of pathogens. “The age-old idea was that you couldn’t touch neutrophils,” Sapey says. But a series of clinical trials has offered reassurance that it can be safe to restrain the cells.</p><p>Although some of those trials yielded mediocre results, researchers have pressed on—and their persistence may be paying off. Two clinical trials with neutrophil-focused drug candidates reported encouraging findings last year; one could lead to the approval of the first medication targeting these immune cells, in a rare autoimmune condition. The trial Ferro and his colleagues are conducting, the first to attempt to stem cardiovascular disease by interfering with neutrophils, is expected to have results by 2021 or 2022. And a burst of new findings about the cells’ diversity and behavior is likely to inspire new ways to manipulate them. “There is real hope in this field,” Sapey says.</p><p>NEUTROPHILS FLOCK to the site of an injury or infection, wherever it occurs. The cells navigate to trouble spots with the help of receptors on their surface, such as one known as CXCR2, which detects a trail of alarm molecules released by damaged tissue. If the cells happen upon microbes, they launch a multipronged attack, gobbling the pathogens, spilling corrosive chemicals, and sometimes launching webs of DNA, known as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), that snag and kill the invaders. Hematopoietic stem cell transplants given to some cancer patients to replace their bone marrow underscore the importance of these defenses. “If the graft doesn’t take, you will have no neutrophils, and that is not survivable,” says immunologist Klaus Ley of the La Jolla Institute for Immunology.</p><p>Yet studies over the past 2 decades have darkened their image. The cells in effect “drop atomic bombs” in the body, says immunologist Paul Kubes of the University of Calgary. Neutrophil elastase and other chemicals they discharge may drive inflammation and damage to the airways in cystic fibrosis and intractable cases of asthma. NETs, for their part, can provoke the immune system to attack a patient’s own cells in the autoimmune disease lupus, and they spur formation of blood clots in the potentially lethal condition deep-vein thrombosis. NETs can also worsen arterial plaques by promoting inflammation, cell biologist Venizelos Papayannopoulos of the Francis Crick Institute in London and colleagues found in 2015. Neutrophils can even abet cancer, spurring growth of new blood vessels that feed tumors and helping the abnormal cells spread to other parts of the body.</p><p>More than 10 years ago, such disease links prompted some companies to begin to develop compounds that inhibit neutrophil elastase. Others tried to restore neutrophils’ navigational abilities, which are faulty in COPD and other conditions, by blocking the protein PI3K, an enzyme involved in controlling cell movement.</p><p>More than a dozen clinical trials scrutinized these potential drugs in many conditions. The good news is that the compounds didn’t cripple defenses against infections. But most of the trials found minimal benefits. As a result, several big pharmaceutical companies have given up. In 2019, GlaxoSmithKline jettisoned danirixin and nemiralisib, the two neutrophil-targeting drug candidates it had been developing for lung diseases. Merck and AstraZeneca have also recently abandoned once-promising compounds.</p><p>But researchers say there’s still hope, arguing they haven’t yet pinned down what doses to use, how best to deliver potential drugs, and which aspects of neutrophil biology to target. In trials for COPD and other lung disorders, Sapey notes, patients inhaled the compounds. But because most neutrophils ply the bloodstream, inhaled drugs may not reach faulty cells, she says. Nervous about side effects, investigators may also have kept doses too low.</p><p>Hematologist and oncologist Steven Pavletic of the U.S. National Cancer Institute and his colleagues think they can do better. In a phase I safety trial, Pavletic and his team have started to give larger amounts of the neutrophil elastase inhibitor alvelestat to patients with the lung condition bronchiolitis obliterans. The ailment strikes a significant percentage of people who receive hematopoietic stem cell transplants during cancer treatment, developing when immune cells from the transplant attack the recipient’s own tissue. Neutrophils swarm into the lungs and may encourage scar tissue to build up in the bronchioles, the lungs’ smallest airways, which can cause them to clog. For transplant recipients, bronchiolitis obliterans is like having an unstoppable asthma attack, Pavletic says.</p><p>He adds that alvelestat probably won’t reverse bronchiolitis obliterans, but by blocking neutrophil elastase, it could stop the disease from getting worse. “Even a marginal improvement could lead to a major improvement in lung function.”</p><p>Researchers are further along in evaluating a way to target neutrophils to treat a rare autoimmune disease in which the immune system produces antibodies against its own neutrophils—a condition known as antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) vasculitis. The antibodies glom onto the cells, which then get stuck in small blood vessels and release their chemical load, leading to inflammation that can cause kidney damage and other problems. In the first year after diagnosis, patients with the disease are nine times more likely to die than people in the general population, and current treatments, which include steroids and immune-suppressing drugs, are one reason for this high mortality, notes nephrologist David Jayne of the University of Cambridge.</p><p>In a recent trial involving 331 ANCA vasculitis patients, Jayne and colleagues tested the experimental drug avacopan, which stymies C5a, a protein in the blood that helps spur neutrophils to release their inflammation-promoting contents. The results of the phase III trial, announced late last year, revealed that the drug was about 20% more likely to produce remissions after 1 year than steroids were. It improved patients’ kidney function and was also less harmful than steroids. Jayne predicts avacopan will be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and “will be a complete replacement for steroids” in treatment of ANCA vasculitis.</p><p>Although many efforts to target neutrophils aim to inhibit them, Sapey and her colleagues believe rejuvenating neutrophils could help boost immune function in older people. An existing drug, the cholesterol-lowering medication simvastatin, may do the job, they found. Simvastatin had caught their attention because some evidence suggested people taking it for high cholesterol are less vulnerable to infections. When the team members exposed neutrophils to simvastatin in the lab, they found it boosts the cells’ migration accuracy and improves their performance in other ways. And in a phase II trial of the drug in 62 older people with bacterial pneumonia and sepsis, Sapey and her colleagues determined that adding simvastatin to the normal treatment regimen reduced the severity of infections and allowed the patients to spend more time out of the hospital over the next year.</p><p>“That was highly unexpected and very exciting,” says Sapey, whose team reported the findings last year in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. They are now planning a larger study of the drug, and she says it might also work against other common bacterial problems in the elderly, such as urinary tract and skin infections.</p><p>THE THERAPEUTIC POSSIBILITIES are likely to broaden as researchers learn more about the biology of neutrophils. The cells have traditionally been seen as the immune system’s cannon fodder—simple, expendable killers. But neutrophils, it turns out, aren’t so simple after all. “They are not merely the cells that clear microbes from infected sites,” Papayannopoulos says.</p><p>“The most exciting thing is that the cells are much more heterogeneous than we thought,” says immunologist Leo Koenderman of University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands. With techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing, researchers have discovered that neutrophils come in multiple varieties. And their properties can vary by time of day. In humans, the cells are much more aggressive toward pathogens at night than during daylight hours, and they crank up different genes depending on the hour.</p><p>This diversity enables the cells to specialize and take on more tasks than researchers expected. Some neutrophils have moved up the chain of command and help control the activity of other immune cells. For example, they can either spur T cells to attack pathogens or rein them in. The cells can also take on alternative roles when they enter damaged tissue. If they encounter microbes, they become fighters. But if an injury is not infected, they become healers. Chemicals they release can stimulate new blood vessels to form and spark the production of replacement cells.</p><p>Intravital microscopy, which reveals the movements of cells within the body, suggests the lives of these immune cells are eventful. Researchers long assumed that once neutrophils left the bloodstream and moved into infected or injured tissues, they would eventually self-destruct, allowing the inflammation at the site to clear. But several microscopy studies have revealed more complex migrations. In a 2011 study, for example, Anna Huttenlocher of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and colleagues tracked neutrophils in zebrafish that had wounds on their fins. The scientists found that individual neutrophils moved into and out of a wound several times before eventually departing for good.</p><p>Now, Ferro and his colleagues are trying to interrupt one leg of the neutrophils’ journey. In patients with heart disease, the cells worm into the fatty plaques lining the coronary arteries. There, they release chemicals, including neutrophil elastase, that may make these plaques more likely to fracture and spawn blood clots, which can trigger heart attacks.</p><p>The drug candidate that Ferro and colleagues are testing in people with serious plaques, AZD5069, blocks CXCR2, the receptor that helps neutrophils navigate to infected and inflamed locations. In animal tests, the compound deters neutrophils from entering sites of inflammation.</p><p>Death rates from cardiovascular diseases have been dropping for decades in many countries thanks to lifestyle changes, such as a decline in smoking, as well as drugs that lower cholesterol and combat blood clotting. But heart disease still kills more than 600,000 people in the United States every year. “There’s clearly a big gap that remains in therapy for these patients,” Ferro says. Within a couple of years, he hopes to know whether deflecting neutrophils can help.</p><p>Some researchers remain skeptical that the current crop of experimental neutrophil-targeting drugs will work outside certain rare diseases. The cells have multiple redundant pathways that control their activity, Koenderman notes. A neutrophil “is extremely robust,” he says. The idea that a single drug could correct its misbehavior “is pretty naïve,” he says.</p><p>However, researchers are already developing new approaches, including DNA-destroying enzymes that might slice up NETs and prevent blood clots. And as scientists dig deeper into the cells’ biology, they may find new ways to keep these immune soldiers in check, Fessler says. “There is hope that with increasing understanding of neutrophils, we will have more sophisticated approaches down the line.”</p>\",\"date\":\"Apr. 22, 2020\",\"link\":\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/new-drugs-aim-disarm-immune-system-s-atomic-bomb-cells\",\"discrp\":\"\\n      New drugs aim to disarm the immune system’s ‘atomic bomb’ cells      \\n  \\n      Neutrophils defend against infection but can cause disease when they malfunction  \\n\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","{\"content\":\"<p>Building a beautiful robotic hand is one thing. Getting it to do your bidding is another. For all the hand-shaped prostheses designed to bend each intricate joint on cue, there’s still the problem of how to send that cue from the wearer’s brain.</p><p>Now, by tapping into signals from nerves in the arm, researchers have enabled amputees to precisely control a robotic hand just by thinking about their intended finger movements. The interface, which relies on a set of tiny muscle grafts to amplify a user’s nerve signals, just passed its first test in people: It translated those signals into movements, and its accuracy stayed stable over time.</p><p>“This is really quite a promising and lovely piece of work,” says Gregory Clark, a neural engineer at the University of Utah who was not involved in the research. It “opens up new opportunities for better control.”\\n</p><p>Most current robotic prostheses work by recording—from the surface of the skin—electrical signals from muscles left intact after an amputation. Some amputees can guide their artificial hand by contracting muscles remaining in the forearm that would have controlled their fingers. If those muscles are missing, people can learn to use less intuitive movements, such as flexing muscles in their upper arm.</p><p>These setups can be finicky, however. The electrical signal changes when a person’s arm sweats, swells, or slips around in the socket of the prosthesis. As a result, the devices must be recalibrated over and over, and many people decide that wearing a heavy robotic arm all day just isn’t worth it, says Shriya Srinivasan, a biomedical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p><p>But there’s another way to tap into a person’s intended movements: by listening to the nerves that transmit the brain’s commands down the arm. Wires planted directly into these nerves can capture electrical signals to control a prosthesis. But the signals are faint, and small movements of the fine nerve fiber relative to the recording electrode can change or obscure the nerve’s subtle message.</p><p>So researchers have tried to boost nerve signals by connecting them to a muscle. Some have rerouted nerves from the arm into a chest muscle and picked up the strong electrical signal as a person contracts that muscle by thinking about moving their hand.</p><p>But surgeons must strip out some existing nerves in the chest to route in the new ones. As Clark puts it, “There’s only one car that can fit in the parking spot.” That means the procedure may compromise a muscle some amputees use to move their remaining upper arm.</p><p>For about 10 years, a team led by plastic surgeon Paul Cederna at the University of Michigan (UM), Ann Arbor, has been developing an alternative approach: Give the nerves new minimuscles of their own. The researchers isolate bundles of fibers from each of the major nerves in the arm and wrap each bundle in a chunk of muscle tissue roughly the size of a paper clip, often harvested from the thigh. The process basically creates a new set of finger muscles inside a person’s forearm or bicep.</p><p>Because wrapping nerves this way also relieves certain types of pain common after an amputation, hundreds of people have already had the procedure—but without the wire implants that could record from the muscles to control a prosthesis. In a new study out today in Science Translational Medicine, Cederna and UM neural engineer Cynthia Chestek describe the first test of that control step.</p><p>In three participants with amputations at different points along the arm who already had muscle implants, wires inserted through the skin near the muscle grafts could easily pick up their electrical signals, the researchers report. Even with an amputation up near the shoulder, a computer could interpret which tiny muscles were contracting, and by how much, to isolate different intended movements—a flex of the pointer finger versus the thumb, for example.</p><p>“The isolation that they get with these little muscle grafts is really quite remarkable,” Clark says.</p><p>Two of the participants—both with amputations at the wrist—opted for long-term electrode implants, which allowed further tests of their hand control. Using computer algorithms that “learned” to translate electrical signals into intended movements, the participants could prompt a virtual hand on a computer screen to assume any of five positions on cue. And when controlling a commercially available prosthesis called the LUKE arm, both participants could move the thumb to precise targets in space and pick up and stack a set of small wooden blocks.</p><p>Because the prosthesis relies on signals from nerves naturally involved in hand movement, participants could get it to move the way they wanted it to on the first try, Chestek says; there was nothing for them to learn. And without recalibrating the system, her team found that participants maintained the same degree of control after 300 days. “There’s no reason it would go away,” Chestek says. “The nerve is stable and happy.”</p><p>The setup isn’t ready for prime time. For now, wires tether participants to the lab equipment that reads and interprets the electrical signals. Chestek and Cederna eventually plan to develop a compact implant that doesn’t require wires that stick out through the skin. If the device can be optimized and win regulatory approval, it might offer amputees robotic appendages that are less of a handful.</p>\",\"date\":\"Apr. 22, 2020\",\"link\":\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/minimuscles-let-amputees-control-robot-hand-their-minds\",\"discrp\":\"\\n      Minimuscles let amputees control a robot hand with their minds      \\n  \\n      Approach could make manipulating a prosthesis more natural, precise, and reliable  \\n\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","{\"content\":\"<p>When 109-year-old Jessie Gallan was asked about the secret to her long life, she replied “staying away from men.” Other people older than 100 have extolled the virtues of everything from crossword puzzles to tap dancing. One thing they don’t usually mention: chromosomes. Yet, across the animal kingdom, individuals with identical sex chromosomes—including women with double Xs—live nearly 18% longer than their counterparts with mismatched chromosomes, a new study reveals.</p><p>In most animals, sex chromosomes help determine whether an individual develops as a male or female. In mammals, females typically have two identical X chromosomes, whereas males have one X and one much smaller, or “reduced,” Y chromosome. Sexes of some animals, such as most male arachnids, lack a second sex chromosome entirely. These chromosomes contribute to the physical differences between males and females. Birds with ZZ sex chromosomes, for example, are male and tend to be more colorful, whereas ZWs are females with typically blander plumage.</p><p>Physical traits aren’t the only differences between the sexes. Researchers hypothesize that animals with mismatched sex chromosomes, such as XY male mammals, could be more vulnerable to genetic mutations, which could result in a shorter life span. But until now, scientists haven’t studied this effect across the animal kingdom.</p><p>So researchers at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, scoured scientific papers, books, and online databases for sex chromosome and longevity data. They compared the life spans of males and females of 229 animal species across 99 families, 38 orders, and eight classes. On average, the sex with identical chromosomes lives 17.6% longer, they report today in Biology Letters. The longevity pattern holds for humans, wild animals, and captive animals across the evolutionary family tree.</p><p>“I thought it was really cool how, across insects and fish, we’re all showing the same sort of response,” says the study’s lead author, ecologist Zoe Xirocostas.</p><p>Still, the researchers found that the life span disparity varies markedly between species. At one extreme, female German cockroaches (Blattella germanica), with XX sex chromosomes, live 77% longer than single-X males. The disparity also varies depending on whether the animal with matching sex chromosomes is female or male. Females with identical sex chromosomes—such as mammals and some reptiles, insects, and fish—live an average of 20.9% longer than males, but in males with matching sex chromosomes, such as birds and butterflies, the life span gain over females is just 7.1%.</p><p>This unevenness hints that factors other than the presence of certain sex chromosomes might also strongly influence longevity, the team says. One of these factors could be sexual selection. Exaggerated physical traits and elaborate behaviors make males of some species more attractive to females but require large amounts of energy and take a toll on overall health.</p><p>“We know that sexual selection is stronger in males,” says evolutionary biologist Gabriel Marais from Claude Bernard University Lyon, who was not involved in the research. Males “pay the cost of this sexual selection by faster aging, and they will die younger,” Marais says.</p><p>If those males also have reduced or absent sex chromosomes that leave them vulnerable to mutations, the deleterious effects on life span add up, Marais says. In comparison, female birds and butterflies with mismatched sex chromosomes might be more vulnerable to mutations, but they don’t face the life span reduction of intense sexual selection.</p><p>Further work could help researchers understand how sex chromosomes impact life span. For example, researchers don’t yet know whether the size of the reduced sex chromosome corresponds to the difference in life span between males and females. “There are so few papers about this question,” Marais says. He praises the new study as an important step in the right direction.</p>\",\"date\":\"Apr. 22, 2020\",\"link\":\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/secret-long-life-matching-sex-chromosomes\",\"discrp\":\"\\n      The secret to a long life?

He wants to preserve a record of humanity that could survive for eons, to be read by successors to Homo sapiens on Earth or by sapient extraterrestrials. He has now found the right medium, he thinks: the DNA of an odd microbe that lives in deposits of rock salt. He believes this archive—protected by salt and renewed by the microbe—could possibly survive for hundreds of millions of years.</p><p>It’s a visionary idea, owing as much to art as science. Davis, an artist affiliated with a Harvard University biology lab, bridges both worlds. His project took a step forward last week with a study posted on bioRxiv, a preprint repository. In the study, Davis and his colleagues show they can encode information in the DNA of Halobacterium salinarum (Hsal)—a hard-to-kill, salt-tolerant microbe that has, on average, 25 backup copies of each of its chromosomes.</p><p>Other researchers have explored the storage potential of DNA, which packs the equivalent of about 300 megabytes of data into the nucleus of a human cell. But Davis is combining that capacity with the resilience of an extraordinarily hardy organism. “If you want to keep data for a long, long time, the best way to do that may be to hold it inside cells and utilize the cellular machinery for DNA self-repair,” he says. “They can conveniently and economically reproduce themselves with little or no intervention.”\\n</p><p>Jeff Nivala, a biological engineer at the University of Washington, Seattle, who studies halophiles and DNA storage, agrees. “For archival storage over millions of years, this might be a great application,” he says. “If all other life is destroyed on Earth, and this is the only thing left, maybe that information could propagate on its own.”</p><p>Davis has no formal training in biology, save for a single course at a Mississippi junior college in the 1960s. But he has a record of turning biology into performance art that sometimes leads back to science. In 1987, for an artistic venture called Microvenus, he encoded a depiction of the female form into the DNA of living Escherichia coli bacteria—a feat that is widely cited as the first experimental demonstration of DNA data storage.</p><p>Now, Davis is working with a tougher microbe than E. coli. Hsal can withstand desiccation, thermal extremes, prolonged vacuum, and intense radiation. Davis has even exposed it to ethylene oxide, a poisonous gas used to sterilize laboratory equipment, with no discernible effects. Hsal does have a kryptonite: Immersion in freshwater bursts its cells. But when entombed in briny pockets within salt crystals, Davis muses, Hsal could be “the thing that couldn’t die.”</p><p>For commercial DNA storage, in vitro techniques—encapsulating synthetic DNA in glass or stainless steel—are more advanced than in vivo approaches, says Emily Leproust, an organic chemist and CEO of Twist Bioscience. But living things could preserve DNA far longer, says Davis, who has revived hibernating Hsal cells from salt deposits hundreds of millions of years old. His collaborator, Harvard geneticist George Church, considers it “totally plausible” that the cells found deep within stable crystals survived all this time in a dormant state. The cells stop growing, and their DNA remains unchanged except for gradual degradation, he says. “But they can also replicate quickly when they need to,” he adds, repairing damage and generating lots of copies for researchers to work with. “So Hsal appears to be a good choice.”</p><p>Jocelyne DiRuggiero, a Johns Hopkins University biologist and Hsal expert, regards the plan as “a cool idea.” Besides enduring environmental stresses, she says, Hsal is good at removing reactive oxygen species that harm DNA. With minimal nutrients, an Hsal colony could hibernate in salt for hundreds of thousands of years or more, she says. The microbes would not grow or reproduce, she says, and would only use energy to make repairs and counteract threats, such as DNA damage from cosmic rays.</p><p>The first step in the new work was to encode data in Hsal’s DNA. Davis chose the coordinates for a 3D picture of a needle and egg—objects in a Russian folktale about a wizard who hid his soul in the tip of a needle concealed inside an egg. After Davis synthesized the DNA, Alexandre Bisson, a biologist at Brandeis University, attached it to a site in the Hsal genome that wouldn’t affect the microbe or produce anything in the cell. Bisson encouraged the modified halobacteria to replicate and sequenced their DNA to ensure the new code was unaltered.</p><p>To learn more about the microbes’ potential as time capsules, Bisson is studying how they behave in salt crystals, which “is largely a mystery.” Over the course of 10 years or more, he plans to compare Hsal strains encased in salt with “parent” or control strains kept in a freezer to see whether any mutations occur in the presumably more active salt strains. That data will help fill a void, though extrapolating it to millions of years “would be a stretch,” he says. Bisson also plans to use fluorescent proteins to find out whether the organisms stay trapped within the briny pockets that sustain them or if they move around.</p><p>Davis hasn’t lost sight of the project’s primary motivation. “What kind of legacy should humans leave behind as a species?” he asks. Davis doesn’t claim to know; he plans to gather input from scientists, historians, artists, poets, and philosophers. But he wants to safeguard more than just information. “I want to preserve the meaning,” he says.</p>\",\"date\":\"Apr. 22, 2020\",\"link\":\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/02/hardy-microbe-s-dna-could-be-time-capsule-ages\",\"discrp\":\"\\n      Hardy microbe’s DNA could be a time capsule for the ages      \\n  \\n      Artist and DNA storage pioneer says microbes entombed in salt could preserve a lasting record of humanity  \\n\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","{\"content\":\"<p>The bricks in Wil Srubar’s lab at the University of Colorado, Boulder, aren’t just alive, they’re reproducing. They are churned out by bacteria that convert sand, nutrients, and other feedstocks into a form of biocement, much the way corals synthesize reefs. Split one brick, and in a matter of hours you will have two.</p><p>Engineered living materials (ELM) are designed to blur boundaries. They use cells, mostly microbes, to build inert structural materials such as hardened cement or woodlike replacements for everything from construction materials to furniture. Some, like Srubar’s bricks, even incorporate living cells into the final mix. The result is materials with striking new capabilities, as the innovations on view last week at the Living Materials 2020 conference in Saarbrüken, Germany, showed: airport runways that build themselves and living bandages that grow within the body. “Cells are amazing fabrication plants,” says Neel Joshi, an ELM expert at Northeastern University. “We’re trying to use them to construct things we want.”</p><p>Humanity has long harvested chemicals from microbes, such as alcohol and medicines. But ELM researchers are enlisting microbes to build things. Take bricks, normally made from clay, sand, lime, and water, which are mixed, molded, and fired to over 1000°C. That takes lots of energy and generates hundreds of millions of tons of carbon emissions annually. A Raleigh, North Carolina, company called bioMASON was among the first to explore using bacteria instead of heat, relying on the microbes to convert nutrients into calcium carbonate, which hardens sand into a sturdy construction material at room temperature.\\n</p><p>Now, several groups are taking the idea further. “Could you grow a temporary runway somewhere by seeding bacteria in sand and gelatin?” asks Sarah Glaven, a microbiologist and ELM expert at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. In June 2019, researchers at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio did just that to create a 232-square-meter runway prototype. The hope, says Blake Bextine, who runs an ELM program for the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, is that rather than ferrying tons of materials to set up expeditionary air fields, military engineers could use local sand, gravel, and water, and apply a few drums of cementmaking bacteria to create new runways in days.</p><p>The bricks and runway cement don’t retain living cells in the final structure. But Srubar’s team is taking that next step. In their self-reproducing bricks, researchers mix a nutrient-based gel with sand and inoculate it with bacteria that form calcium carbonate. They then control the temperature and humidity to keep the bacteria viable. The researchers could split their original brick in half, add extra sand, hydrogel, and nutrients, and watch as bacteria grew two full-size bricks in 6 hours. After three generations, they wound up with eight bricks, they reported in the 15 January issue of Matter. (Once the bacteria are done growing new bricks, the team can turn off the temperature and humidity controls.) Srubar calls it “exponential material manufacturing.”</p><p>ELM makers are also harnessing microbes to make biomaterials for use in the human body. Microbes naturally exude proteins that bind to one another to form a physical scaffold. More bacteria can adhere to it, forming communal microbial mats known as biofilms, found on surfaces from teeth to ship hulls. Joshi’s team is developing biofilms that could protect the gut lining, which erodes in people with inflammatory bowel disease, creating painful ulcers. In the 6 December 2019 issue of Nature Communications, they reported that an engineered Escherichia coli in the guts of mice produced proteins that formed a protective matrix, which shielded the tissue from chemicals that normally induce ulcers. If the approach works in people, physicians could inoculate patients with an engineered form of a microbe that normally makes its home in the gut.</p><p>In another medical use, bacteria could turn conventional materials into drug factories. In the 2 December 2019 issue of Nature Chemical Biology, for example, Christopher Voigt of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his colleagues describe seeding a plastic with bacterial spores that continuously generate bacteria. The microbes synthesize an antibacterial compound effective against Staphylococcus aureus, a dangerous infectious bacterium.</p><p>A team of researchers led by Chao Zhong of ShanghaiTech University engineered biofilms for a different purpose: detoxifying the environment. They started with the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, which secretes a matrix-forming protein called TasA. Other researchers had shown that TasA was easy to genetically engineer to bind to other proteins. The team tweaked TasA to get it to bind an enzyme that degrades a toxic industrial compound called mono (2-hydroxyethyl terephthalic acid), or MHET. They then showed that biofilms created by the engineered bacterium could break down MHET—and that biofilms made by a mix of two engineered strains of B. subtilis could carry out a two-step degradation of an organophosphate pesticide called paraoxon. The results, which the team reported in the January 2019 issue of Nature Chemical Biology, raise the prospect of living walls that purify the air.</p><p>Regulatory issues could slow progress, however. Many of the bacteria that ELM researchers have harnessed occur in nature and should not trigger regulatory scrutiny. But genetically engineered organisms will—and the prospect of engineered microbes embedded in, say, living walls might unsettle regulators. Still, Voigt predicts, “I think in 10 years, we’re going to find living cells in a whole range of living products.”</p>\",\"date\":\"Apr. 22, 2020\",\"link\":\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/02/living-cement-medicine-delivering-biofilms-biologists-remake-material-world\",\"discrp\":\"\\n      From ‘living’ cement to medicine-delivering biofilms, biologists remake the material world      \\n  \\n      Engineered microbes shift from making molecules to materials  \\n\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","failed"]
