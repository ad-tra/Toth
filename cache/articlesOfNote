Perhaps she’d mistaken him for one of his portraits, because over the previous decades no artist had been better at manipulating canvas and paint to give the illusion of real human bodies, stilled lives. Everything about a self-portrait like Reflection (1985), from its intent pink-rimmed eyes to the shiny patch on its forehead, makes it look as if it is not a painting but a person, who is on the verge of leaning out of the frame to touch the viewer—though whether to kiss them or headbutt them it is hard to say.</p><p>All portraits are more than simple objects. A portrait is the representation of one body that has been created by the touch of another; it is a silent duet, a stationary pas de deux. That is why, in Freud’s view, not everyone was a suitable subject to be painted by him. It is also why, according to William Feaver in the superb second volume of this eye-opening biography, Freud’s quest for people to be persuaded or seduced into sitting for him never ceased. Actually there usually wasn’t much sitting involved once Freud had managed to get you into his studio. Most models were expected to remove their clothes and splay themselves on a bed or a pile of rags, often holding uncomfortable poses for hours at a time. And if they were young and female Freud didn’t restrict himself to touching up their portraits. Sometimes he would come close and fondle their bones and muscles like “a trainer in a racing stable running a hand idly over brisket and withers.” At other times he went further still. “To sit was to serve, more often than not in more than one capacity,” Feaver writes, evenly.</p><p>Some models failed to return once they realised that, although Freud was fascinated by their bodies, their own names would never appear in any catalogue or gallery; they were merely a way for the portrait to achieve its own form of independent life. Others had to accept that he was going to depict what he really saw rather than perpetuate a more flattering public image of them. Supermodel Kate Moss was painted while she was pregnant, and at the base of her real spine Freud tattooed her with two swallows set like inverted commas. (“An original Freud,” she boasted, adding that if the modelling work dried up “I could get a skin graft and sell it.”) A small portrait of the Queen was commissioned after Freud was awarded the Order of Merit in 1993, capturing a face that appeared to be at once eminently practical and unexpectedly fond of sly jokes. (Both of these characteristics were revealed when the Queen was reported to have said that she stayed as silent as she could during the sittings, “Because when he talks he stops painting.”)</p><p>Alongside these star models there were ordinary people like the picture framer Louise Liddell, painted as Woman Holding Her Thumb (1992). She once cursed God for her fat ankles, whereupon Freud said “I thank God for them.” There were also plenty of approaches from strangers volunteering their services. “A man wrote to me and said, ‘I’m sure you’d like to paint me because I have no ears, despite which I’m a vicar,’” Freud told Feaver. And of course there were chance encounters with potential models he spotted in bars or clubs, such as a “rather amazing girl with a sore part under her nose as if she’d been up to something,” whom Freud thought that getting to know would be “rather exhilarating.”</p><p>There are echoes here of the first volume of Feaver’s biography, which was packed with good stories about Freud’s rackety private life and rollicking friendships with fellow artists like Francis Bacon. The same elements are also present in this second volume, including some splendid vignettes of Freud kicking a gallery owner he disliked (“Treated it like a penalty kick: just a quick below-the-kneecap”) and trying to deal with the many children he had sired over the years, not all of whom he “recognised,” as Feaver neatly puts it. The main difference is that here these stories are little more than bits of highlighting, like the patch of shiny skin in Reflection. Instead the focus throughout this volume is on Freud’s daily routine in his studio: a spacious top-floor flat in 36 Holland Park, where two or three different scenes could be arranged under the skylight at any one time, and where the walls gradually filled up with paint scraping and scribbled phone numbers. If Feaver’s first volume was a portrait of the artist playing around, here the main focus is Freud at work.</p><p>Sometimes, Feaver reports, when a painting was nearing completion, Freud would step back from the canvas and “as though taunting himself” would murmur “How far can you go?” It is a question that goes to the heart of his career. In his younger days it had encouraged him to steal from his parents and gamble money that wasn’t his to stake. Now that he was an established artist the main uncertainty was what would happen each time he started a new work.</p><p>It was a wager that he was always in danger of losing, and his studio filled with abandoned canvases bearing only a few experimental smudges of paint. His etchings were riskier still, because each time an image was scratched into the metal plate and dipped, there was the chance that it could become a blurry mess. Even the paintings he carried on with were surprisingly unpredictable until he decided that they were finished, and Feaver does an excellent job of letting us look over Freud’s shoulder as he goes about his work in the studio. Impulses are explored and later painted out; tiny physical details are given the attention usually reserved for whole lives (“Got up at half past four with the intention of doing the handle on the easel,” in The Painter Surprised by a Naked Admirer); extra strips of canvas are attached to widen the original painting, as his model stretches out and Freud tries to give them enough space to be themselves: “Allow the life full swing.”</p><p>The finished painting was not a vision that had been realised, like an architectural plan that had become a real building. Instead it depicted a relationship that had developed over the weeks or months Freud and his model had spent together. As David Hockney astutely observed of the portrait Freud painted of him in 2002, “It’s not me; it’s an account of looking at me by a very intelligent and skilled painter.” Sometimes these relationships lasted a lifetime, like the astonishing series of portraits Freud produced of his mother, in which the longer he spent in her company the further she seemed to withdraw inside her own head; or they unfolded over several years, as in Freud’s portraits of the performance artist Leigh Bowery, a man who somehow combined the bulk of a heavyweight wrestler with the grace and poise of a ballet dancer. At other times they did not unfold so much as unravel, as when Freud tried to include the model Jerry Hall in a group portrait, and later painted over her to turn her into a man after she failed to turn up to all the sittings he had demanded.</p><p>Another comment by Hockney about portrait-painting—“It’s a duration, not a moment”—might also be applied to the most important relationship in this book, between Freud and his biographer. As a young art critic Feaver first got to know Freud in 1973, and it wasn’t long before his life was caught up in the painter’s slipstream. They would talk regularly on the phone, sometimes more than once a day (“Hello, Villiam. How goes it?”), and as Feaver assembled a record of these conversations it seems that the notoriously private Freud gradually reconciled himself to the appearance of a biography in which he would not be analysed too much—throughout his life the ghost of his grandfather Sigmund continued to hang heavily over the family—and would usually be allowed the last word.</p><p>What kind of book did he expect? Apparently in conversation he referred to it as Feaver’s “funny art book,” and like the first volume this second instalment contains some excellent stories. We are told about Freud posing a Japanese laboratory rat after first tranquillising it with champagne and sleeping pills; Freud dealing with difficult social situations by reciting chunks of “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” to himself; Freud’s neck-craning response to a traffic accident outside his studio: “I hoped there’d be arms and legs lying around. I need that for something.” The main narrative is also punctuated by Freud’s waspish one-liners, which Feaver reports with neutral relish. On Mother Theresa: “Not someone to sit next to at lunch.” On his brother Clement: “We never got on. He’s dead now. Always was, actually.” For the most part Feaver seems happy to act as Freud’s comic stooge, giving his friend the best lines and only occasionally adding an aside of his own, as when he reports Freud’s confident claim that “I like ironing. Everyone does,” before quietly adding in parenthesis: “[This from someone who had rarely, if ever, used an ironing board.]”</p><p>The jokes are important, because although it is a common assumption that artists lead tragic lives—garrets, starvation, doomed love affairs and so on—as seen through Feaver’s eyes Freud’s life was more like a comedy. That wasn’t just because it was a story with a happy ending, as the prices of his paintings grew from tens of thousands to millions of pounds, accompanied by retrospective shows at venues like the Centre Pompidou and the Tate, and including frequent trips on Concorde or his New York dealer’s private jet. It is also because throughout Freud seems to have behaved like a modern clown: a figure who was driven by strong appetites, told the truth when it was uncomfortable or unwanted, and used paint to play a complicated game in which self-revelation was strangely mixed up with self-disguise.</p><p>The main difference, of course, is that clowns never seem to age, whereas at the time that Freud complained “I’m not an object,” his spark was already starting to fade. It is painful to read about someone’s decline in a biography and especially so when the subject was as full of life—and of lives—as Freud. From the earliest signs of approaching old age, which took the form of arthritic pains in one shoulder, to the final months of cancer and mental confusion leading up to his death in 2011, Freud’s decline is outlined by Feaver in the unsentimental way his subject would probably have wanted. There are even echoes of Freud’s unfinished portraits in the way Feaver spaces out the final years, producing the narrative equivalent of physical gaps left on an abandoned canvas. The result is a biography that is as generous and unsparing as Freud’s own best work. At once personally intimate and critically detached, perceptive on the art (his summary of one etching is that the model has “the look of one who rather thought she’d just forgotten something frightfully important”) but never trying to compete with it, Feaver’s biographical portrait is an unforgettable achievement.</p><p>In the end he also recognises that his subject will unavoidably slip through his fingers. Soon after they first met, Freud appeared at Feaver’s front door looking tense and asking for him. They arranged to meet again the next day, before Freud “paused on the step as though deciding what further to say then turned and vanished into the dark.” At the time it might have seemed merely shy or elusive. Now it reads more like an allegory of the biographical enterprise.</p>\",\"date\":\"2020-8-29\",\"link\":\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/the-lives-of-lucien-freud-william-feaver-review\",\"discrp\":\"Lucian Freud at work.

One had “this fragment of a story by Chekhov: ‘… and suddenly everything became clear to him’”. For Carver, these words are “filled with wonder and possibility. I love their simple clarity, and the hint of revelation that’s implied. There is mystery, too. What has been unclear before? Why is it just now becoming clear? What’s happened? Most of all – what now?” The quote might not belong to Anton Chekhov at all (no one has ever found the story it’s from), but Carver’s description of its effect, its ability to stage a revelation and in the same moment open a field of greater mystery, absolutely does.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tRichard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky’s new translation of 52 Chekhov stories doesn’t include many of his most famous works (their versions of those can be found in a collection from 2000, only available in the UK as an e-book). But walking the overgrown pathways of his less familiar stories can help give a fresh sense of why his storytelling has been so influential, and remains compelling in its own right.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tConsider the last page of “Neighbours”, from 1892, in which Pyotr Mikhailych, a young man who “already had all the makings of an old bachelor landowner”, sits miserably beside a pond as the moon rises. He thinks he sees a man across the water, standing motionless. Remembering a story about a seminarian who was beaten to death nearby, he wonders if this is his ghost. But when he rides around the pond the figure turns out to be no more than a rotten post, the remnant of some old shed.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tPyotr’s uncertainty is quickly resolved. But for us, reading Chekhov’s often indeterminate, emotionally puzzling stories, the solution is not so simple. In the closing lines Pyotr reflects that he has never said or done what he really wanted to, “and therefore the whole of life now looked to him as dark as this water in which the night sky was reflected and waterweeds were entangled. And it seemed to him that it could not be set right.”\\n</p><p>\\n\\tThe extremity of Pyotr’s realisation is a shock, a surprise ending of sorts, yet while these are usually enlisted to tie things up, here very little feels settled. Earlier in the story Pyotr visits the estate of his neighbour Vlasich, the divorcé his younger sister Zina is now living with. “Neighbours” might be relatively minor Chekhov (written just a couple of months after “Ward No 6”, one of his most famous stories), but Pyotr’s visit to Vlasich shows him at his most skilful, conjuring a full spectrum of emotion from a stream of conversation that’s now sludgy and mannered, now running fast with emotion and revelation, now drying up completely (“The two were silent for a time and pretended to be listening to the rain”).\\n</p><p>\\n\\tThe longer the characters talk, or don’t talk, the more can be interpreted and the less clear everything becomes. Pyotr cannot talk to Zina the way he used to, perhaps because her liaison with Vlasich has sexualised her in his eyes. But is he jealous of Zina for finding love, which has eluded him, or jealous of Vlasich and in love with his sister? “I don’t even know for certain what I actually think,” he despairs beside the pond.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tChekhov works to sustain this uncertainty and plunges us into it too. Revising the story, he deleted a line that seemed too definitive: “I had gone to settle something, but not a single one of life’s questions can have a special solution; in each separate case you must say and do what you think – that is the solution to all questions.” Lines like this survived the red pen in other stories he wrote, but they never appear as conclusions. “In my opinion,” he told Ivan Bunin the first time the writers met, “after one finishes a story one should cross out the beginning and the end. It is there that we writers lie most of all.” The end of a Chekhov story is nearly always left ajar.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tChekhov’s grandfather was a serf who purchased his freedom. His father was a shopkeeper in Taganrog, on the Sea of Azov, and a tyrant (the story “Difficult People” provides a damning portrait). His insolvency, coupled with Chekhov’s early success as a writer of comic stories at the age of 20, having moved to Moscow to attend medical school, made the third son the family’s breadwinner. Chekhov practised medicine alongside writing, saying that it “significantly broadened the scope of my observations, and has enriched me with branches of knowledge whose true value for me as a writer can only be understood by someone who is a doctor himself”.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tChekhov is hardly a writer’s writer, but it might be said that short story writers believe, correctly or not, that they alone understand his true value. Carver is one of many who have learned the lessons Chekhov’s work teaches. On the cover of my copy of Carver’s Elephant (1988) a review quote describes him as “the American Chekhov”. “Errand”, the last story in the book and the last Carver saw published in his lifetime, describes Chekhov’s death. But the more important connection is his distinctively Chekhovian manner of dispersing meaning into apparently irrelevant details, and the pronounced open-endedness of his stories. Carver, however, was not the only American Chekhov: by the 1980s the appellation was threadbare with use. Addressing Cornell University’s Chekhov Festival in 1976, John Cheever told his audience he was “one of perhaps ten American writers who are known as the American Chekhov”.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tThe description isn’t unhelpful because it’s used carelessly, but because Chekhov’s influence is so widespread: most short story writers are Chekhovians, whether they realise it or not. Playwrights, too: asked about his influences Tennessee Williams replied, “Chekhov! As a dramatist? Chekhov! As a story writer? Chekhov!” Keeping to the short story in English, early disciples included Katherine Mansfield, Sherwood Anderson and Ernest Hemingway, and from here his influence quickly ramifies: AE Coppard, Katherine Anne Porter, Eudora Welty, Flannery O’Connor, Bernard Malamud, John Cheever, Raymond Carver, Alice Munro, Yiyun Li and Joyce Carol Oates, who rewrote him with her “Lady with the Pet Dog”. This is only a sampling.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tAll these writers have learned from what Elizabeth Bowen, another disciple, called the “inchoate or nebulous” quality of Chekhov’s stories. In 1937 she wrote that he “opened up for the writer tracts of emotional landscape; he made subjectivity edit and rule experience and pull art, obliquely, its way”. It is as if he made a more finely graduated colour wheel available to the writers who followed him, summoning into being what Conrad Aiken called, in a 1921 essay, “a range of states of consciousness which is perhaps unparalleled”. Mood, Aiken suggests, was both Chekhov’s method and effect. If his characters seem unmemorable next to those of, say, Tolstoy, “it is because so often our view of them was never permitted for a moment to be external – we saw them only as infinitely fine and truthful sequences of mood”.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tThis wasn’t enough for Somerset Maugham, who devoted an inordinate amount of the preface for his own collected stories to simultaneously praising and burying Chekhov. Maugham cannot take his tendency towards the oblique: “If you try to tell one of his stories,” he complains, “you will find that there is nothing to tell.” Doubtless Chekhov “would have written stories with an ingenious, original and striking plot if he had been able to think of them. It was not in his temperament. Like all good writers he made a merit of his limitations.”\\n</p><p>\\n\\tThe truth is that Chekhov’s approach was essentially lyrical, and he was never interested in the things Maugham says he fails to achieve. As DS Mirsky noted in his 1926 History of Russian Literature, when reading Chekhov “it is not interest in the development [of the story] that the reader feels, but ‘infection’ by the poet’s mood”.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tThis mood is often one of inertia. This is particularly true of the mature period, which began in 1888 when Chekhov stopped writing weekly comic stories and began publishing in the so-called “thick journals”, which afforded him greater time and space. At the end of “The Lady with the Little Dog”, “Fear”, “Big Volodya and Little Volodya”, and numerous others, the characters return more or less to wherever they were when the story began – minus some of their illusions – or poised at the lip of an uncertain future.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tFor the translator Michael Henry Heim, the fact that in these stories “things peter out or go on as they have before” – that they stop, rather than conclude – “does not mean that nothing has happened; it means that nothing – or, rather, less than the characters may have hoped for – has changed”. It’s an important distinction. The stasis Chekhov’s stories so often describe (“My life had become boring again, like it had been before,” as the landscape painter N remarks at the end of “The House with the Mezzanine”) isn’t heightened in the manner of Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot, but emotionally mimetic. Where change does occur it doesn’t provide completion, but only reveals a new set of problems; in a letter of 1888 Chekhov said it wasn’t an author’s job to give answers, but formulate the right questions.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tGuy de Maupassant is the only genuine rival to Chekhov in terms of shaping the modern short story. Although Chekhov borrowed from Maupassant – a debt he nods to in The Seagull – they were very different writers, and the difference is starkest in how they approach endings. Maupassant favoured ones that snap shut: the payload that the story’s mechanism delivers. Impressive, often ingenious, but cold and cynical; a story that closes as smartly as a joke can render hollow whatever life it has called into being.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tBy contrast, Chekhov’s method allows his stories to become part of the continuum of a reader’s day: less memorable in their specifics, but more persistent in effect. Their ragged edges possess an uncanny ability to knit themselves into our memories as things felt, as ongoing “sequences of mood”. “I want the story to exist somewhere so that in a way it’s still happening,” Alice Munro has said, “or happening over and over again. I don’t want it to be shut up in the book and put away – oh well, that’s what happened.” Chekhov would agree with every word of this.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tMeaning is provisional in even the most apparently self-explanatory of Chekhov’s stories. “The Student”, from 1895, was Chekhov’s own favourite. It describes Ivan, a seminarian, walking home after a cold spring afternoon’s shooting. He stops beside the fire of two peasant women, a mother and daughter. The fire reminds him of the gospel story of Peter denying Jesus. He tells it, the old woman begins to cry, and a tense expression comes to her daughter’s face as though she is stifling pain.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tThe story ends with Ivan analysing what just happened. He decides the women’s reactions prove their connection to the story of Peter, which inspires a realisation regarding the interconnectedness of past and present, “an unbroken chain of events, which flowed from one into another”. Most analyses of the story take this at face value, despite Chekhov’s atheism, but doing so ignores his tendencies to a remarkable degree.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tFor one thing, setting is never accidental in Chekhov – his landscapes, for example, filled with “mournfully drooping willows”, “malicious” storms and “disgusting” rains, are consistently anthropomorphic – and when Ivan interprets the women’s reactions the fire flickers in the darkness some way behind him, and they are no longer visible. Just as they are physically obscured, perhaps the truth behind their reactions is also beyond his ability to see. We have been told, seemingly incidentally, that the daughter, a widow, was beaten by her husband. Perhaps Ivan’s mention of the beating of Jesus brought back her own pain. Her mother’s tears might not be spurred by faith, but by shame for giving her daughter to such a man. “The Student” is a story about storytelling, after all, and it is in the nature of Chekhov’s stories to be profoundly unstable.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tCritical consensus says Ivan’s revelation is genuine. This is understandable; Bunin reports that Chekhov thought “The Student” contradicted those critics who called him “gloomy”. But regardless of his intent, it is notable that even in such a brief story his impulse for ambiguity and irresolution should result in the availability of more than one reading. “Everything on this earth,” Chekhov wrote in a letter of 1887, “is relative and inexact,” and this apprehension permeates his work. As the farmer Alekhin comments in “About Love”, before telling a story of unspoken words and unresolved feeling, “We decent Russian people entertain a partiality for these questions that remain without answers.” \\n</p>\",\"date\":\"2020-8-28\",\"link\":\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2020/08/how-chekhov-invented-modern-short-story\",\"discrp\":\"“After one finishes a story, one should cross out the beginning and the end,\\\" said Chekhov. \\\"It is there that we writers lie most of all”  .\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","{\"content\":\"<p>‘Let’s face the considerable evidence that all sitting is harmful,” writes Galen Cranz, a design historian whose book The Chair traces this object’s long history. Not all sitting, of course. For people who use wheelchairs, they’re an elegant and crucial technology. And sitting itself is not the culprit; any unchanging, repetitive motion or posture fails to give the body the variation it needs. But Cranz, writing primarily for an audience of ambulatory readers in industrialised and therefore sedentary societies, is one of many researchers who have been saying for decades that chairs are a major cause of pain and disability.</p><p>Sitting for hours and hours can weaken your back and core muscles, pinch the nerves of your rear end and constrain the flow of blood that your body needs for peak energy and attention. Most people’s bodies are largely unsuited to extended periods in these structures. Extensive research confirms that sitting in chairs is correlated, Cranz notes, with “back pain of all sorts, fatigue, varicose veins, stress and problems with the diaphragm, circulation, digestion, elimination and general body development”. There is growing evidence that relentlessly sedentary jobs – in some, such as bus driving and forklift operating, bodies are literally strapped to chairs – are harmful enough to shorten life expectancy.</p><p>For most of human history, a mix of postures was the norm for a body meeting the world. Squatting has been as natural a posture as sitting for daily tasks, and lying down was a conventional pose for eating in some ancient cultures. So why has sitting in chairs persisted in so many modern cultures? As with all material objects, Cranz reminds us, function tells only part of the story. The other part, always, is culture – the inherited and sometimes arbitrary ways that things have always been done, and therefore continue as common practice. “Biology, physiology and anatomy have less to do with our chairs than pharaohs, kings and executives,” she writes.</p><p>One kind of historical chair, called the “klismos” by historians, developed primarily as a historical expression of status. Setting a body higher than and apart from other people, in an individual structure with rigid, flat planes – a throne, if you will – evolved as a way of recognising an individual’s power, with the earliest known models dating to ancient Egypt and south-eastern Europe. Their use as an expression of authority continued throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and the endurance of this symbolism lives on as metaphor in many contemporary leadership titles; to chair the committee or the department, or to sit in the designated “director’s chair” on a film set, is still to hold a seat of power.</p><p>In the centuries prior to western industrialisation, stools or benches were common household furnishings, but chairs were special-occasion objects, usually the exclusive property of the wealthy and powerful. The era of mass manufacturing in the 19th century, and the rapid social and economic changes that came with it, brought chairs into daily life for the first time. Industrial jobs, with their repetitive tasks, required a seated posture, and the high demand for chairs that this created in turn made them available and affordable to middle-class people in Europe and the US.</p><p>“Chair-and-table culture,” Cranz writes, has become fully entrenched in many parts of the world since then. Modern interior designers have done their part to perpetuate chairs as a fashionable and practical norm, reinventing the form again and again in its aesthetics, though not nearly enough in its ergonomics. Chairs are four-legged creatures with anatomical backs and bottoms, familiar to humans because they stand up, almost like animals, beckoning us with their lifelike structures to sit down. Cranz notes that they appeal to humans, and perhaps especially designers, with this blend of the “architectonic and the anthropomorphic”: they are structurally interesting and an echo of the body itself.</p><p>But while they remind us of the human form, chairs rarely do much to actually support it. For instance, many chair designs feature big, soft cushions that seem to indicate comfort, but in ergonomics, the consensus contradicts this padded aesthetic. Cranz writes that “an overpadded chair forces the sit bones to rock in the padding rather than make contact with a stable surface, thereby forcing the flesh in the butt and thighs to bear weight”.</p><p>How can a nice cushioned chair that screams comfort be so ill-suited to most actual bodies? The real science of ergonomics, Cranz argues, should point designers toward chair design that supports and enables the body’s need for movement, not stillness – with seats that angle downward in front, for example, and have a base that’s flexible enough for the sitter to shift their body weight from leg to leg. But for the most part, these principles are ignored in favour of fashion and cheap manufacturing.</p><p>Chairs are generally not a response to the realities of the body, its natural evolution, or its needs over any extended period. Instead, the industrialised body has devolved in its needs and succumbed to chairs. “We design them,” Cranz writes, repurposing a famous line of Winston Churchill’s, “but once built, they shape us.”</p><p>Naturally, there have been plenty of attempts by designers to reinvent sitting. There are kneeling chairs, bouncing balls, perch-style stools with rounded bottoms to encourage shifts in weight and movement. There are flexibly designed chairs such as the Tripp Trapp for children, with pegs for adjusting the seat and leg supports to grow with a young body. Some offices have started to introduce standing desks. But at the average restaurant, in the ordinary classroom, and on trains, buses and aeroplanes, you’ll still find chairs that are mostly at odds with any idea of comfort.</p><p>It’s not just chairs, of course – so many of the products brought to market by the profession of industrial design were not created for many bodies. Instead, they were designed to be plentiful, novel rather than necessary, and cheap. One famous designer, Victor Papanek, memorably dubbed these bad designs a form of “do-it-yourself murder”.</p><p>“Never before in history have grown men sat down and seriously designed electric hairbrushes, rhinestone-covered file boxes, and mink carpeting for bathrooms, and then drawn up elaborate plans to make and sell the gadgets to millions of people,” he wrote in 1971. “Today, industrial design has put murder on a mass-production basis. By designing criminally unsafe automobiles that kill or maim nearly 1 million people around the world each year, by creating whole new species of permanent garbage to clutter up the landscape, and by choosing materials and processes that pollute the air we breathe, designers have become a dangerous breed.”</p><p>Papanek was calling out his entire profession when he wrote these words. Design for the Real World, his first book, was a fiercely argued polemic about the misguided operations of industrial design in the mid-20th century, a call for designers to question what Papanek witheringly referred to as “shroud design” – a preoccupation with the way things look on the outside, at the expense of how they should function and how robustly and sustainably they are made. He understood how the products with which we navigate daily life match (or fail to match) the bodies and tasks they are meant to conjoin as tools. He likened his peers’ shirking of their responsibilities to “what would happen if all medical doctors were to forsake general practice and surgery, and concentrate exclusively on dermatology and cosmetics”.</p><p>Papanek was responding to the heady early days of truly mass manufacturing in the aftermath of the second world war, when supply chains expanded to previously unimaginable scale, fuelled by an equally huge advertising industry. Papanek understood the job of product design to be an ambitious one – to “transform man’s environment and tools and, by extension, man himself” – but he saw in the giddiness of postwar growth a moment when designers lost their way. An overwhelming cultural belief and investment in technology created a cultural appetite for whatever seemed shiny and new, and the industry now pandered to it.</p><p>The public’s ready acceptance of these shiny new objects, whose lifespan was meant to last only until the next new thing arrived, created an allegiance among designers to what Papanek called “the dark twins of styling and obsolescence”. Manufacturing for styling, amplified by advertising, resulted in an empty desire for unnecessary objects that became quickly unusable. And objects that were created purely for ephemeral desire, in turn, created a whole ethos of obsolescence – an accepted disposability that made for a dangerous neglect of safety standards, resulting in needless injury from common household objects. At the time of his writing, he claimed that 600 women annually lost a hand in injuries brought about by top-loading washing machines. When operating at its worst, design resulted in needless injury, but in its everyday mediocrity it also created conditions where objects were not in harmony with the needs of the people for whom they were designed.</p><p>As Papanek observed, there is a wide gulf between the people who use TV remotes, car dashboards and other everyday items, and the people who make the design decisions that bring those items into being, who are driven or constrained by motives other than ease of use. The bodiedness of people gets lost, especially in the sedentary workplace, where human labour is imagined not as flesh and muscles, but as measurable economic deliverables, organised by roles and tasks. Yet the work is carried out by bodies all the same, not just in chairs, but among the angular shapes of desks and copiers and countertops, alongside mechanical and digital machines. The passive as well as active physical requirements of our workdays tax our bodies, whether we bend repeatedly to harvest berries or sit still in a phone bank for hours on end.</p><p>Papanek was particularly barbed in his assessment of design’s failure to allow for non-normative bodies. He called for a much closer focus on people and conditions whose needs were commonly written off by his design counterparts as “special”: older people, people with disabilities, elementary school students, and any population considered beyond the scope of the middling mainstream. But as Papanek pointed out, we were all children once, and almost all of us become, in turn, adolescents, middle-aged people and older adults. If we combine all the “seemingly little minorities [and their] ‘special’ needs,” he wrote, we discover that “we have designed for the majority after all”.</p><p>Post-Papanek, designers continued to wrestle with the conundrum of chairs. In the late 70s, the office furniture giant Herman Miller commissioned independent designers Bill Stumpf and Don Chadwick to look for opportunities in the furniture market, gaps that new products might fill and thereby expand the company’s market share. In the course of their research, Stumpf and Chadwick, seasoned observers of humans and designed environments, noted one particular context in which chairs were creatively adapted but ill-suited to their sitters: older adults who spent a lot of their day sitting in La-Z-Boy recliners, watching TV or doing otherwise passive activities.</p><p>They noted that the recliner had even become a makeshift medical treatment chair; they witnessed it being used, for example, in a half-reclined state for people undergoing dialysis treatment. Despite the advantages of its variability in pitch and support structures, however, it was the wrong chair for many of the conditions that come with ageing. Older adults with weakened muscles had trouble getting in and out or reaching the lever for changing positions, and the deep padding, used for its presumed comfort, put people who sat for long periods at risk of bedsores.</p><p>Inspired by the spirit of the recliner, Stumpf and Chadwick reconsidered all of its traditional features and generated a prototype called the Sarah chair , which they pitched to Herman Miller in 1988. It had all the flexibility of a recliner and more – multiple ways to choose the pitch of the back, seat and arms, and a flexible footrest for changing positions more easily. They reduced the padding significantly, making a thinner and more breathable seat structure. The model was popular in-house as a chair with purpose – many Herman Miller staff could imagine it being useful for their grandparents, for example. But the mass-market appeal wasn’t obvious at first, and the firm rejected the Sarah in its first iteration, only to revive the design a few years later.</p><p>For the second version, Stumpf and Chadwick imagined the ergonomic features of the chair with ageing still in mind, but also the body of the average office worker, commonly tethered for long stretches to a personal computer and keyboard. They got rid of the foam padding altogether, making the model’s signature new aesthetic a cushionless seat of thick plastic webbing that would support the shapes of any body, not just an ageing one. The Aeron was a wild success, quickly taken up as a status symbol in high-end office environments like those in Silicon Valley.</p><p>Aeron chairs have become a canonical, if expensive, example of what’s called “universal” design and its variants, barrier-free and inclusive design. This principle is what many people think of when they hear the words “disability” and “design” together. The logic of universalism goes like this: designers gain surprising and powerful insights from looking closely not at norms and averages – not at people whose experiences fall well inside the expected middle of a curve – but instead at people and scenarios at the margins of experience, so-called extreme users. Good designers, the thinking goes, will take a close look at unusual circumstances, places where products (or environments, or services) are full of friction for people with particular needs. There, in the margins of human experience, are clues to suboptimal conditions that may also affect people in the normative middle, though perhaps to a lesser degree.</p><p>In the case of disability, that would mean closely observing older adults and wheelchair users, and people on the autism spectrum, say, and then abstracting from those observations. What is working for these people, and what isn’t, based on what they say or do, or what they don’t say or do? Where might improvements be introduced to address those points of friction at the margins, the places where design isn’t working? After a series of prototypes and testing, the process aims to make a more user-friendly, ergonomic, accessible product (or service, or environment) for all – in principle, at least, design “for everyone”.</p><p>It wasn’t Papanek who offered universal design to the world; it was disabled people whose long-held insights generated what became a set of principles that designers could follow. Ronald Mace, a wheelchair user and architect, is credited with introducing the term “universal design” to the public in 1985. In part, the coinage was strategic, recasting features of design that had been considered “special” as simply good design, resulting in products and buildings that were straightforwardly “usable by all people”.</p><p>The universal design principles that Mace and others in the disability community generated read like an antidote not only to the preoccupation with “styling and obsolescence” that Papanek called out, but also to the “murderous” results of negligent design; they include principles such as “simple and intuitive use”, “perceptible information”, “low physical effort”, and perhaps most important of all, “tolerance for error”.</p><p>Universal design isn’t restricted to high-end items such as the Aeron chair. If you go looking for kitchen tools in your average store, for example, you’ll easily find the Oxo Good Grips line, with the familiar thick black pliable rubber handles that have just enough give to hold comfortably, and just enough sturdy resistance to offer leverage. The brand began with a vegetable peeler, an object so everyday as to be invisible – and that peeler originated, as design often does, in a complaint that inspired an idea.</p><p>In the late 80s, a woman named Betsey Farber was attempting to use a standard metal vegetable peeler in the holiday house she was renting with her husband, Sam, a retired entrepreneur. The tool was frustrating to use, especially because Betsey had arthritis. So, right there in the kitchen, Sam and Betsey started to sketch out ideas for a new version of a peeler. With further refinement, those ideas resulted in the now-ubiquitous Oxo design: fins on the sides elegantly indicate the place to put your thumb in order to optimise the mechanics of use, a visual cue for intuitive handling. When you hold the peeler against a carrot, it encourages you to apply just enough pressure to catch a ribbon of skin without cutting too deeply, and without a reckless amount of slip that would send both carrot and peeler flying from your hands.</p><p>Sam Farber came out of retirement and went to work on the peeler, and the idea that he and Betsey hatched was taken up in a partnership with a product design firm that went on to create the Good Grips line: can openers, salad tongs and other tools made for the subtle work of manual kitchen tasks. Thus went a now-classic universal design success story, which has taken its place in the canon alongside that of the Aeron chair, as inspiration to a generation of would-be practitioners.</p><p>There are other stories besides. Designer Marc Harrison was commissioned by Cuisinart in the late 70s to overhaul its commercial-grade food processor into a more consumer-friendly domestic model. The company didn’t ask Harrison to address disability as a use case for its product, but Harrison’s research and teaching at Rhode Island School of Design had included years of collaborative work on furniture for rehabilitation settings and wheelchair-accessible housing. Those experiences nourished the insights Harrison brought to the processor. He introduced things such as large-print, high-contrast lettering for the labels, and controls that flipped like paddles rather than requiring fiddly turning. These and other features were informed by usability principles Harrison had learned from looking closely at disability. This kind of commitment and imagination in design yields products and experiences that can make life better without you even noticing it.</p><p>Disability is the little-acknowledged heart of the innovation in many digital tools, too. The history of the telephone, for example, is tightly bound up with research on deafness. Alexander Graham Bell’s work with deaf students and their teachers solidified his research on making speech visible, reducible to signals and therefore transmittable by electronic means. That research made telephone technology possible, but it also helped set in motion the standardisation of signal processing that was crucial to early computing.</p><p>In the US, perhaps the most hidden-in-plain-sight of examples of these innovations is the landmark change to media consumption that happened after disability activists fought for closed-captioning technology to be built into every standard television. The Television Decoder Circuitry Act, passed in the US in 1990, required the technology to be a standard part of the television manufacturing process, rather than an extra device attached alongside it. The battle to pass the legislation was difficult and protracted, in the face of resistance from within the communications industry about the perceived extra expense it would entail. But thanks to the economy of scale created by the legislation, the cost of adding this capacity to televisions is now so small that it is almost impossible to calculate. Meanwhile, closed captioning has become a standard feature of daily life. It’s how you follow along with sports matches across a restaurant or airport terminal, and it’s how you understand clips from an election debate on your laptop with the sound off, making it possible to multitask when your kids are in the next room trying to get to sleep.</p><p>It would be easy to conclude from these stories that universal design is dispatching “murderous” objects to the dustbin of history, and that it alone points the way to a more accessible future. Designing ergonomic objects that can be mass-produced and affordable enough to find their way into the hands of people who need them is an unassailable good. But disability scholars also point to the ironies created by the work that Mace and his ilk set in motion. One is that while the dominant model of universal design has disability at its centre, the very success of the innovations it generates tends to obscure their origin stories, as in the case of the Oxo peeler. That success makes many people overlook the barriers that still exist to an adaptive, flexible world for disabled people. Universal design also tends to stoke an unquestioned faith in the importance of products, attained by consumers, as the key to building a desirable world. A better product might be useful in the short term, but sometimes it’s a better process, or a better system, that’s needed to provide a long-term solution.</p><p>Take, for example, the Leveraged Freedom Chair, a design created with paraplegic wheelchair users in parts of the world where accessible streets are rare. Amos Winter, director of the Global Engineering and Research Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), did years of trial-and-error field research with his team in Tanzania, Guatemala and India, in order to collaboratively design a chair with variable torque in driving, even in off-road terrain, using very simple technology. Depending on where you grab one of its extended handles, you get more or less mechanical advantage, just like switching gears on a bicycle, which makes uneven pavement or dirt roads much more navigable. A third wheel in front adds balance. “We failed a number of times,” Winter has said. The design process “has to start and end with end users”, he says. “These are the people who have to define the requirements of the technology, and give it the thumbs-up at the end.”</p><p>Getting the seat, frame and handles in the right positions to be both comfortable and advantageous in their physics was an engineer’s task of very fine designing and building. But the real ingenuity isn’t in the mechanics; it’s in the sustainable system for repair and maintenance. Many wheelchair companies make their chairs with their own proprietary parts, so even if they donate free chairs to people who need them, the parts are expensive to replace, and the chairs become unusable when they break. If a wheelchair is going to last in a rural area among populations who aren’t rich, says Winter, “it has to be repairable using the local tools, materials and knowledge in those contexts”. The Freedom Chair was made of globally standardised and affordable bicycle parts, so they can be repaired and replaced anywhere in the world.</p><p>“To make something cheap and simple and reliable often takes rigorous engineering,” says Winter. “What is the solution that will give you the required performance for as little money and as little complexity as possible?” The Leveraged Freedom Chair was not a compromise; it wasn’t a chair that was “good enough” for the people who use it. It was the right design for specific people in specific contexts, and it was designed to last. </p><p>• Adapted from What Can a Body Do?

Photograph © Tate (CC-BY-NC-ND 3.0).</p><p>It’s the rare story that’s equally familiar to both engineers and literature students: On December 28, 1879, a train was carrying passengers across Scotland’s River Tay from Wormit to Dundee on a very windy evening. The Tay Bridge, which had been completed only a year earlier, spanned some two miles. When it opened, it was the longest railway bridge in the world; the chief engineer was honored for his achievement with a knighthood from Queen Victoria. But this same engineer had neglected to ensure that his construction would withstand particularly heavy gales, and as the train’s six cars reached the center of the bridge’s span, the structure gave way, plunging an estimated seventy-five passengers and crew members into the river’s freezing depths. No one survived.</p><p>The incident made front-page news across Britain. Queen Victoria had a missive sent directly to the lord provost of Dundee: “The queen is inexpressibly shocked, and feels most deeply for those who have lost friends and relatives in this terrible accident.” (Initial reports suggested that the death toll was higher, around two hundred, further compounding the intensity of national emotions.) Despite the carnage, however, the wreck is principally known today as the occasion for one of the English language’s clumsiest poetic efforts, William McGonagall’s “The Tay Bridge Disaster.” Here is one of its infamous stanzas:</p><p>So the train mov’d slowly along the Bridge of Tay,\\n\\t\\tUntil it was about midway,\\n\\t\\tThen the central girders with a crash gave way,\\n\\t\\tAnd down went the train and passengers into the Tay!\\n\\t\\tThe Storm Fiend did loudly bray,\\n\\t\\tBecause ninety lives had been taken away,\\n\\t\\tOn the last Sabbath day of 1879,\\n\\t\\tWhich will be remember’d for a very long time.</p><p>The syntax of the “Disaster” is tortuously arranged to hit the poem’s rhymes; its literalness preempts any possibility for gravitas or emotional weight; and its meter seems beamed in from an alien universe. Undermined by its own technical haplessness, written with the impregnable conviction of the talentless, the “Disaster” is a heartfelt paean to the doomed train passengers that—however ironically and unfortunately—better serves as a memorial to the poet’s own buffoonery.</p><p>Not unjustly, McGonagall is rarely mentioned without an epithet: some version of “the worst poet in the English language.” And by any reasonable account, any judgment based on the most universally shared values of poetics, prosody, and taste, there is little to admire in McGonagall. The rest of his corpus shares—replicates, really—the faults of “The Tay Bridge Disaster”: its lapses into bathos, its involuted syntactical structures, its rhymes so slanted as to be more or less horizontal.</p><p>Photographs from the Tay Bridge inquiry, c. 1886. Commissioned by John Trayner. National Library of Scotland (CC BY 4.0).</p><p>There have been worse poets, of course, and as such it would be more accurate to describe McGonagall as the worst famous poet in the English language, a testament in part to the man’s powers of self-promotion and the caprices of literary history. But McGonagall’s notoriety still owes much to the singularly strange power of his own badness. There’s something, I think, in poems like “The Tay Bridge Disaster”—as well as McGonagall’s many poems on his great themes of death and destruction—that is worth examining; something that might redeem him, ever so slightly, from the annals of amusing semi-obscurity; something unsettling about his ostensibly blinkered artistic vision that might help to account for why he lingers as the patron saint of misbegotten verse.</p><p>Scotland has justifiably claimed him as its own, but in all likelihood McGonagall was born in Ireland, in 1825. His family migrated to Dundee when William was a child, and like much of the city’s population, he grew up to be a weaver. The textile business was booming then, though the apogee of the mechanical revolution wasn’t far behind. And as the industry began to make workers redundant amid its collapse in 1877, McGonagall had a conveniently timed epiphany. Sitting in his room on a spring day, he recalls, “I seemed to feel as it were a strange kind of feeling stealing over me…I imagined that a pen was in my right hand, and a voice crying, ‘Write! Write!’” He complied, writing a graceless tribute to the Scottish preacher George Gilfillan (himself a poet, although the misfortune of having been eulogized by his fellow Dundonian has been the better part of his literary legacy). McGonagall sent the results to Dundee’s Weekly News, where they were subsequently published by a deeply bemused editorial staff.</p><p>What followed over the next two and a half decades was one of the most bizarre careers in Victorian letters. The Weekly News proved a reliable publisher, though it often accompanied McGonagall’s hapless texts with scathingly ironic commentary (a courtesy they were not inclined to extend to their more traditional poetic contributors). Encouraged by what he misconstrued to be rightful artistic recognition, the poet took to local theaters to read his own works and recite Shakespearean soliloquies, whereupon he was often met with raucous crowds who either mockingly encouraged him—sometimes carrying him aloft into the streets—or pelted him with garbage. (Contemporary accounts allege that among the objects he was barraged with were potatoes, footwear, rotten eggs, fish, sacks of soot, peas, snowballs, and, on at least one occasion, a brick.) His profile rising amid these riotous performances, McGonagall increasingly became the victim of a number of cruel pranks, which only served to inflate his own sense of vocational destiny. He trekked to Balmoral Castle seeking an audience with Queen Victoria after someone had passed him a sham letter of patronage; he was tricked into dining with an imposter posing as the dramatist Dion Boucicault; and in the last years of his life, McGonagall was made a knight of the fictional “Holy Order of the White Elephant,” an honor supposedly bestowed upon him by the king of Burma, and of which he proudly and obliviously boasted until his death.</p><p>Another contemporaneous example of bad Tay Bridge poetry, from an unnamed poet. National Library of Scotland (CC BY 4.0).</p><p>Many of McGonagall’s poems, which he churned out at a reliable clip after his poetic conversion, were benign and banal odes to Scottish and English landscapes in the manner of a one-man lyrical tourism bureau. He writes that Crieff, a trendy nineteenth-century vacation spot, “is admirably situated from the cold winter winds / And the visitors, during their stay there, great comfort finds, / Because there is boating and fishing, and admission free, / Therefore they can enjoy themselves right merrily.” What’s more: “There is also golf courses, tennis greens, and good roads, / Which will make the traveling easier to tourists with great loads.” The specificity of McGonagall’s laundry list of amenities is at every point undermined, in his typical manner, by a penchant for recycling some wonderfully ungainly idioms. Parts of Montrose in “Bonnie Montrose,” for instance, are “most magnificent to be seen,” “most charming to be seen,” and “most beautiful to see,” in three successive stanzas. Even with their regional particularity, the poems feel perfectly interchangeable. The poem’s titles often do the work of announcing the sameness of their portrayals: “Bonnie Kilmany” and “Bonnie Callander,” “Beautiful North Berwick” and “Beautiful Village of Penicuik.”</p><p>Despite a penchant for the versified guidebook, however, the principal thematic fixture of McGonagall’s career was cataclysm. “The Tay Bridge Disaster” was only the inaugurating work in a long series of calamity chronicles. It seems as if the poet never met a catastrophe that he didn’t contrive to transform into misguided elegy. Shipwrecks were his forte, but any disaster would do, really. He memorialized the victims of fires, tornadoes, stampedes, floods, military routs, any mass-casualty event that would have found its way into the Dundee press. According to Norman Watson, McGonagall’s biographer, out of the 270 poems attributed to McGonagall, twelve are on funerals, six on fires, fifty on battles, and twenty-four on “maritime disasters.” The poems’ rote, straightforward titles compose a global charnel house of grisly incident: “The Terrific Cyclone of 1893,” “The Pennsylvania Disaster,” “The Horrors of Majuba,” “The Wreck of the Steamer ‘Stella,’ ” “The Great Yellow River Inundation in China.”</p><p>While remaining true to the general principles of McGonagallian style, these poems carried with them their own particular formal and phrasal tics. “The Pennsylvania Disaster,” written to commemorate the Johnstown Flood, is a useful case in point. The poem opens with a kind of dateline: “’Twas in the year of 1889, and in the month of June, / Ten thousand people met with a fearful doom.” The death count established, the reader adequately oriented in historical time, McGonagall moves on to narrate the horrors of the flood in his characteristic tragic mode: comically flattened affect punctuated by mannered exclamations of grief.</p><p>Oh, heaven! it was a pitiful and a most agonizing sight,\\n\\t\\tTo see parents struggling hard with all their might,\\n\\t\\tTo save their little ones from being drowned,\\n\\t\\tBut ’twas vain, the mighty flood engulfed them, with a roaring sound.</p><p>In the end, virtually all of his poems conclude with the assertion that these events “will never be forgot,” or “will be remember’d for a very long time,” manifesting a certain (and ultimately, somehow, warranted) confidence about the afterlife of his verse itself. But in poems like “The Pennsylvania Disaster,” McGonagall also tends to fixate on more particular, character-driven vignettes—a husband and wife lifting a dead child from a burning cradle, an orphaned “beautiful girl, the belle of Johnstown” staring into the torrent of water in which her parents had just drowned, a heroic telegraph operator wiring messages until the bitter end—that often derive from contemporary accounts.</p><p>For that reason, Watson and other critics have contended that McGonagall’s poetry might be considered a kind of nineteenth-century news broadcast. It’s a neat way of making sense of these poems’ strangeness—their fixation on specificity of number, time, and place might be McGonagall’s way of incorporating or transforming the generic markers of “news” into literature. His plodding couplets constitute a kind of doleful formal grid onto which any instance of horror can easily be installed, not unlike the strictures of an Associated Press dispatch or evening news segment. But I found myself wondering if his disaster poetry might be less a dramatization of the news than a staging of its consumption.</p><p>The most recognizable elements of his poems—the banal repetitiveness (both across individual works and within them), the recourse to platitude and bromide, the obsession with quantification and particularity—it all bears the contemporary hallmarks of the experience of news. Prior to this year, it was most familiar with regard to mass shootings—the obsessive tracking of the escalating death count; the offerings of hackneyed “thoughts and prayers,” followed by the complaints that have become their own benumbing clichés; the avowals that it will never happen again, supplemented by reassurances that it will be “remembered for a very long time.” Any disaster, in this way, is both devastatingly unique and inevitably iterative.</p><p>Mexican News, by Alfred Jones, after Richard Caton Woodville, 1851. Smithsonian American Art Museum, gift of Mr. and Mrs. Donald F. Fenn, 1976.</p><p>This year we’ve been introduced to the same phenomenon on a far more deadly scale than McGonagall’s most ghastly memorials could have accounted for. But the plot of this infectious disaster still follows the standard arc of his poems, drifting inexorably from particularity toward abstraction and thus detachment, as the Covid-19 death toll in the United States reached five, then six figures. In this sense, McGonagall’s poetry feels eerily familiar, not unlike reading a versified front page of the New York Times. All that’s left to do is count the dead, mourn predictably, and await the next catastrophe, until the dimly recalled horrors of Covid-19 feel as distant as the litany of nineteenth-century disasters toward which McGonagall’s poetry endlessly gravitated.</p><p>The final years of McGonagall’s life, like his poems’ metrical schemas, were a set of frustrated expectations. He had thus far managed to eke out a piddling living through his live performances and the pecuniary kindness of certain acquaintances, but by the end of the nineteenth century he had been banned from most public performances in Dundee. Imposters sent imitations of his work to the local newspapers, one of his sons was accused of breaking the ribs of a local ropemaker, and another was placed in an asylum. The aging poet could hardly leave his home without being ridiculed on the streets with a vehemence that verged on assault. More or less destitute, he took on a few commercial jobs, producing verses in celebration of Sunlight soap and Beecham’s Pills, a laxative.1 When McGonagall died of a brain hemorrhage in 1902, his death certificate misspelled his name.</p><p>McGonagall faded from the public’s imagination for several decades, but the inevitable cult gradually began to coalesce. Appreciation societies were formed, plaques were erected, Dundee and Edinburgh squabbled over who deserved to claim McGonagall as a native son. A 1974 film, The Great McGonagall, starred one of the poet’s biggest boosters, the comedian Spike Milligan, in the title role. (It was a flop, and featured an incongruous nude scene inserted at the insistence of the film’s producer, a noted pornographer.) More recently, J.K. Rowling’s Professor Minerva McGonagall was named for the poet, the belabored joke being the apparent vast intellectual gulf between the clueless William and Greek mythology’s sage Minerva.</p><p>One school of thought still wonders whether or not McGonagall was the genuine rube that he often seems; whether there was a subtle careerism at play, even a knowing hucksterism; and whether he might have been perfectly willing to play to his audience’s expectations for a meager income in desperate times. It’s a theory that could partly explain his fixation on national tragedy: What better way to elevate himself above his provincial status than to garner notice by casting himself as national bard? As poetic town crier on a countrywide scale?</p><p>This is likely an irresolvable question, and any honest account of McGonagall’s career has to settle somewhere in between these two poles—assuming that the poet was aware of the joke if never entirely in on it (by the end of his life, McGonagall’s card identified himself as both a poet and a comedian). But to regard him chiefly as a fool, to laugh at him from a comfortable historical distance, is to ignore the ways in which his disaster poetry, in all its maladroit amateurism, can make contemporary readers uncomfortable, sensitive to the distance, even the callousness, with which the unimaginable must be confronted.</p><p>McGonagall’s poems seem to mark the point at which language fails to adequately respond to a kind of loss that is, perhaps literally, unimaginable. Its desperate recourse is the jumbled McGonagallisms for which the poet is known but with which we’re all familiar as a way of processing tragedy. There’s something funny about “The Tay Bridge Disaster,” to be sure, but I wonder whether its critics have missed the mark about the nature of its comedy. I wonder, especially now, whether it isn’t nervous laughter after all.</p><p>1 In addition to curing constipation, wrote McGonagall, “They are admitted to be worth a guinea a box / For bilious and nervous disorders, also smallpox, / And dizziness and drowsiness, also cold chills, And for such diseases nothing else can equal Beecham’s Pills.” ↩</p><p>\\n                        \\n                            Matthew Sherrill \\n                        \\n                    </p>\",\"date\":\"2020-8-25\",\"link\":\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/disaster-poet\",\"discrp\":\"Satirized, pranked, mocked — even pelted with garbage — the Victorian poet William McGonagall was famous for his terrible art.\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","{\"content\":\"<p>Brutalism has seen a surge in interest among young people keen on bold uncompromising Modernist design.

Consequently, its material standard of living was better than Eastern Bloc states. This book includes contributions addressing various aspects of Yugoslavia’s architectural heritage in Split, Sarajevo, Novi Sad and Pristina.</p><p>East German Modern is a photographic essay on Modernist buildings of the GDR. An introduction is followed by many new photographs of the buildings as they are now. Some are still exciting and distinctive — though somewhat impractical — structures. Others are graffiti-daubed, cracking eyesores that are doubtless due for demolition before long. There is a deep melancholy about these relics of an impossible dream marooned in an economically straitened region suffering from emigration and loss of confidence.</p><p>If these cinemas and piazzas ever thronged on summer evenings, they no longer do so. Windows are broken, moss girts precast walls and grass grows between paving stones. With operating costs no longer absorbed by the state, GDR buildings are expensive, inefficient white elephants. The GDR style of modular Plattenbau with precast concrete elements is one that neither traditionalists nor fans of Brutalism admire. In 40 years’ time no one will be lobbying for its preservation.</p><p>Imagine Moscow outlines how Soviet Man and Woman were to be made efficient, their lives regulated to the minute. Meals would be communal, unmarried individuals sleep in dormitories, married couples be afforded some privacy, children be separated from family members, sport and hobbies be organised group activities, with privacy abolished.</p><p>Efficiencies of scale could be applied to industrialise and communise all aspects of existence. Some of these stipulations were put into practice piecemeal but others proved too complicated, costly or disagreeable. Architecture (including urban planning and public transport) was to be key to developing humanity’s collective potential through social engineering.</p><p>In the 1920s, the only limits were imagination. Concepts were developed for mega-skyscrapers, artificial urban panoramas and floating cities supported by colossal columns. Meanwhile, families were living in corridors of dilapidated expropriated townhouses. Imagine Moscow outlines the interface between Suprematist art and city planning, and Constructivist avant-garde architecture in those heady post-Revolution years when mankind seemed poised to take a great leap forward.</p><p>The universalism of socialist idealism was manifest in the shared use of motifs and theories in fabrics, ceramics, clothing, furniture, architecture and street plans produced in this time. Imagine Moscow includes examples of these plus the photographs, posters, projections and plans that accompanied them.</p><p>The megalomaniacal overreach beloved of dictators and architects reached its apotheosis in 1920s Moscow. This reveals the millenarian religious character of socialism; Soviet advocates often talked in cosmic terms, envisaging the earthly paradises of the proletariat expiating sins of class, capitalism and colonialism. Yet just as notions of Soviet Man foundered upon human nature, so plans for utopian buildings were undone by their essential impracticality.</p><p>There was a plan to move the Pushkin Museum by jacking it up, feeding rollers underneath and dragging it away. The Palace of the Soviets — a mega-skyscraper intended to symbolically supplant the skyscrapers of capitalist New York — was defeated by geology and war. The pinnacle to this tapering wedding-cake montage of a building would have been a 100-metre statue of Lenin.</p><p>Of these books, Soviet Metro Stations is the most purely pleasurable. Most of the stations portrayed are in excellent condition, maintained as expected, undefiled by posters and graffiti.</p><p>The underground networks of major cities around the USSR were one of the unchallenged glories of the Soviet system, excepting the forced labour that was used to construct the earliest infrastructure. In a state with harsh winters, the underground was an efficient transport system, unconstrained by restrictive planning permissions and consultation. The construction of the Moscow metro commenced in the 1930s. The first line opened in 1935.</p><p>Although Soviet Metro Stations is primarily a photographic book, a short but comprehensive introduction details the development, design and history of the various metros in the former USSR. Photographs document the stations of Yerevan, Kharkov, Kiev, Novosibirsk, Tashkent and other cities. Stations were to be palaces of the people. This was not a vain boast. The stations were airy, well-lit and dignified. Décor ranged from the futuristic (pressed geometric metal panels) to the palatial. Other styles adopted were Art Deco, Asiatic and ancient Egyptian. Some stations look eerily similar to the moon bases and space stations found in sci-fi films.</p><p>The de-communisation of Ukraine has meant that Soviet names and artwork on the Kiev metro has been replaced with advertising — a loss to both travellers and design enthusiasts. The single-span vaults with island platforms in the Kharkov metro became emulated designs. With light-coloured geodesic tiling, these bright halls are like glittering ice caverns. Happily, the Kharkov metro has escaped the de-communisation that disfigured Kiev.</p><p>Architecture in Global Socialism covers the outposts of socialism in the Middle East and Africa, the zone of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Global South. In the post-colonial era, nascent countries required the trappings and infrastructure of states: bridges, dams, airports, parliaments, museums, ministries and sports stadiums. The author points out that socialist countries possessed an ideological antipathy towards imperialism and therefore had a fraternal impetus to ally themselves with newly independent nations of the Middle East and Africa. The Iraqi-Syrian Ba’ath parties, Ghana’s Kwame Nkrumah, Uganda’s Idi Amin and Indonesia’s Sukarno incorporated aspects of socialism into their platforms.</p><p>In return for the export of services of architects and technicians for construction projects — and associated credit lines — the socialist nations gained access to favourable trading agreements for raw materials such as rubber, timber, cotton, metals, oil and food. Concomitant soft power of diplomatic, cultural and military ties advanced the interests of both states. These relationships were very complex, multi-layered and rapidly shifting, especially considering the numerous coups and revolutions of post-colonial countries.</p><p>Much of Abu Dhabi’s first-phase state infrastructure was designed and built by Bulgarians, Iraq employed architectural firms from the Eastern Bloc, and Hungarian architects worked in Ghana. Architecture in Global Socialism strikes a generally successful balance between theoretical exposition and historical analysis, liberally illustrated, suitably informed but accessible to the general reader.</p>\",\"date\":\"2020-8-24\",\"link\":\"https://thecritic.co.uk/melancholy-of-obsolete-futures/\",\"discrp\":\"The apotheosis of Brutalism, that megalomaniacal overreach beloved of architects and dictators, was in 1920s Moscow.

She is the author of Complexity: A Guided Tour (2009) and Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans (2019).</p><p>We’re at a unique moment in the 200,000 years or so that Homo sapiens have walked the Earth. For the first time in that long history, humans are capable of coordinating on a global scale, using fine-grained data on individual behaviour, to design robust and adaptable social systems. The pandemic of 2019-20 has brought home this potential. Never before has there been a collective, empirically informed response of the magnitude that COVID-19 has demanded. Yes, the response has been ambivalent, uneven and chaotic – we are fumbling in low light, but it’s the low light of dawn.</p><p>At this historical juncture, we should acknowledge and exploit the fact we live in a complex system – a system with many interacting agents, whose collective behaviour is usually hard to predict. Understanding the key properties of complex systems can help us clarify and deal with many new and existing global challenges, from pandemics to poverty and ecological collapse. </p><p>In complex systems, the last thing that happened is almost never informative about what’s coming next. The world is always changing – partly due to factors outside our control and partly due to our own interventions. In the final pages of his novel One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967), Gabriel García Márquez highlights the paradox of how human agency at once enables and interferes with our capacity to predict the future, when he describes one of the characters translating a significant manuscript:</p><p>Our world is not so different from the vertiginous fantasies of Márquez – and the linear thinking of simple cause-effect reasoning, to which the human mind can default, is not a good policy tool. Instead, living in a complex system requires us to embrace and even harness uncertainty. Instead of attempting to narrowly forecast and control outcomes, we need to design systems that are robust and adaptable enough to weather a wide range of possible futures.</p><p>Think of hundreds of fireflies flashing together on a summer’s evening. How does that happen? A firefly’s decision to flash is thought to depend on the flashing of its neighbours. Depending on the copying rule they’re using, this coordination causes the group to synchronise in either a ‘bursty’ or ‘snappy’ fashion. In her book Patterns of Culture (1934), the anthropologist Ruth Benedict argued that each part of a social system depends on its other parts in circuitous ways. Not only are such systems nonlinear – the whole is more than the sum of the parts – but the behaviour of the parts themselves depends on the behaviour of the whole.</p><p>Like swarms of fireflies, all human societies are collective and coupled. Collective, meaning it is our combined behaviour that gives rise to society-wide effects. Coupled, in that our perceptions and behaviour depend on the perceptions and behaviour of others, and on the social and economic structures we collectively build. As consumers, we note a shortage of toilet paper at the supermarket, so we hoard it, and then milk, eggs and flour, too. We see our neighbours wearing masks, so put on a mask as well. Traders in markets panic upon perceiving a downward trend, follow the herd and, to echo Márquez, end up causing the precipitous drop they fear.</p><p>These examples capture how the collective results of our actions feed back, in both virtuous and vicious circles, to affect the system in its entirety – reinforcing or changing the patterns we initially perceived, often in nonobvious ways. For instance, some coronavirus contact-tracing apps can inform users of the locations of infected persons so they can be avoided. This kind of coupling between local behaviour and society-wide information is appealing because it seems to simplify decision-making for busy individuals. Yet we know from many years of work on swarming and synchronicity – think of the flashing fireflies – that the dynamics of coupled systems can be surprising.</p><p>A recent study in Nature Physics found transitions to orderly states such as schooling in fish (all fish swimming in the same direction) can be caused, paradoxically, by randomness, or ‘noise’ feeding back on itself. That is, a misalignment among the fish causes further misalignment, eventually inducing a transition to schooling. Most of us wouldn’t guess noise can produce predictable behaviour. The result invites us to consider how technology such as contact-tracing apps, although informing us locally, might negatively impact our collective movement. If each of us changes our behaviour to avoid the infected, we might generate a collective pattern we had aimed to avoid: higher levels of interaction between the infected and susceptible, or high levels of interaction among the asymptomatic.</p><p>Complex systems also suffer from a special vulnerability to events that don’t follow a normal distribution or ‘bell curve’. When events are distributed normally, most outcomes are familiar and don’t seem particularly striking. Height is a good example: it’s pretty unusual for a man to be over 7 feet tall; most adults are between 5 and 6 feet, and there is no known person over 9 feet tall. But in collective settings where contagion shapes behaviour – a run on the banks, a scramble to buy toilet paper – the probability distributions for possible events are often heavy-tailed. There is a much higher probability of extreme events, such as a stock market crash or a massive surge in infections. These events are still unlikely, but they occur more frequently and are larger than would be expected under normal distributions.</p><p>What’s more, once a rare but hugely significant ‘tail’ event takes place, this raises the probability of further tail events. We might call them second-order tail events; they include stock market gyrations after a big fall, and earthquake aftershocks. The initial probability of second-order tail events is so tiny it’s almost impossible to calculate – but once a first-order tail event occurs, the rules change, and the probability of a second-order tail event increases.</p><p>The dynamics of tail events are complicated by the fact they result from cascades of other unlikely events. When COVID-19 first struck, the stock market suffered stunning losses followed by an equally stunning recovery. Some of these dynamics are potentially attributable to former sports bettors, with no sports to bet on, entering the market as speculators rather than investors. The arrival of these new players might have increased inefficiencies, and allowed savvy long-term investors to gain an edge over bettors with different goals. In a different context, we might eventually see the explosive growth of Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 as an example of a third-order tail event: a ‘black swan’, precipitated by the killing of George Floyd, but primed by a virus that disproportionately affected the Black community in the United States, a recession, a lockdown and widespread frustration with a void of political leadership. The statistician and former financier Nassim Nicholas Taleb has argued that black swans can have a disproportionate role in how history plays out – perhaps in part because of their magnitude, and in part because their improbability means we are rarely prepared to handle them.</p><p>One reason a first-order tail event can induce further tail events is that it changes the perceived costs of our actions, and change the rules that we play by. This game-change is an example of another key complex systems concept: nonstationarity. A second, canonical example of nonstationarity is adaptation, as illustrated by the arms race involved in the coevolution of hosts and parasites. Like the Red Queen and Alice in Alice in Wonderland, parasite and host each has to ‘run’ faster, just to keep up with the novel solutions the other one presents as they battle it out in evolutionary time.</p><p>Learning changes an agent’s behaviour, which in turn changes the behaviour of the system. Take a firm that fudges its numbers on quarterly earnings reports, or a high-school student who spends all her time studying specifically for a college-entrance exam rather than developing the analytical skills the test is supposed to be measuring. In these examples, a metric is introduced as a proxy for ability. Individuals in the system come to associate performance on these metrics with shareholder happiness or getting into college. As this happens, the metric becomes a target to be gamed, and as such ceases to be an objective measure of what it is purporting to assess. This is known as Goodhart’s Law, summarised by the business adage: ‘The worst thing that can happen to you is to meet your targets.’</p><p>Another type of nonstationarity relates to a concept we call information flux. The system might not be changing, but the amount of information we have about it is. While learning concerns the way we use the information available, information flux relates to the quality of the data we use to learn. At the beginning of the pandemic, for example, there was a dramatic range of estimates of the asymptomatic transmission rate. This variation partly came from learning how to make a good model of the COVID-19 contagion, but it was also due to information flux caused by the fact that viruses spread, and so early on only a small number of people are infected. This makes for sparse data on the numbers of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, not to mention the number of people exposed. Early on, noise in the data tends to overwhelm the signal, making learning very difficult indeed.</p><p>These forms of nonstationarity mean biological and social systems will be ‘out of equilibrium’, as it’s known in the physics and complex systems literature. One of the biggest hazards of living in an out-of-equilibrium system is that even interventions informed by data and modelling can have unintended consequences. Consider government efforts to enforce social distancing to flatten the COVID-19 infection curve. Although social distancing has been crucial in slowing the infection rate and helping to avoid overwhelming hospitals, the strategy has created a slew of second- and third-order biological, sociological and economic effects. Among them are massive unemployment, lost profit, market instability, mental health issues, increase in domestic violence, social shaming, neglect of other urgent problems such as climate change and, perhaps most importantly, second-order interventions such as the reserve banks injecting liquidity into the markets, governments passing massive stimulus bills to shore up economies, and possible changes to privacy laws to accommodate the need to enforce social distancing and perform contact-tracing.</p><p>Do the properties of complex systems mean prediction and control are hopeless enterprises? They certainly make prediction hard, and favour scenario planning for multiple eventualities instead of forecasting the most likely ones. But an inability to predict the future doesn’t preclude the possibility of security and quality of life. Nature, after all, is full of collective, coupled systems with the same properties of nonlinearity and nonstationarity. We should therefore look to the way biological systems cope, adapt and even thrive under such conditions. </p><p>Before we turn to nature, a few remarks about human engineering. Our species has been attempting to engineer social and ecological outcomes since the onset of cultural history. That can work well when the engineering is iterative, ‘bottom up’ and takes place over a long time. But many such interventions have been impotent or, worse, disastrous, as discussed by the anthropologist Steve Lansing in his book Priests and Programmers: Technologies of Power in the Engineered Landscape of Bali (2007). In one section, Lansing compares the effective, 1,000-year-old local water distribution system in Bali with the one imposed by central government engineers during the 20th-century green revolution. This top-down approach disrupted the fragile island and its shoreline ecosystems, and undermined collective governance.</p><p>Fiascos happen when we use crude data to make qualitative decisions. Other reasons include facile understandings of cause and effect, and the assumption that the past contains the best information about the future. This kind of ‘backward looking’ prediction, with a narrow focus on the last ‘bad’ event, leaves us vulnerable to perceptual blindness. Take how the US responded to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 by investing heavily in terrorism prevention, at the expense of other problems such as healthcare, education and global poverty. Likewise, during the COVID-19 crisis, a deluge of commentators has stressed investment in healthcare as the key issue. Healthcare is neglected and important, as the pandemic has made clear – but to put it at the centre of our efforts is to again be controlled by the past. </p><p>Fans of The Lord of the Rings might remember the character Aragorn’s plan to draw Sauron’s eye to the Black Gate, so that the protagonists Frodo and Sam could slip into Sauron’s realm via another route (the lair of a terrifying spider-like monster). The plan relied on Sauron’s fear of the past, when Aragorn’s ancestor cut the powerful ring at the centre of the story from Sauron’s finger. The point is that narrow, emotionally laden focus effectively prevents us from perceiving other problems even when they are developing right under our noses. In complex systems, it is critical to build safeguards against this tendency – which, on a light-hearted note, we name Sauron’s bias.</p><p>There are better ways to make consequential, society-wide decisions. As the mathematician John Allen Paulos remarked about complex systems: ‘Uncertainty is the only certainty there is. And knowing how to live with insecurity is the only security.’ Instead of prioritising outcomes based on the last bad thing that happened – applying laser focus to terrorism or inequality, or putting vast resources into healthcare – we might take inspiration from complex systems in nature and design processes that foster adaptability and robustness for a range of scenarios that could come to pass.</p><p>This approach has been called emergent engineering. It’s profoundly different from traditional engineering, which is dominated by forecasting, trying to control the behaviour of a system and designing it to achieve specific outcomes. By contrast, emergent engineering embraces uncertainty as a fact of life that’s potentially constructive.</p><p>When applied to society-wide challenges, emergent engineering yields a different kind of problem-solving. Under a policy of constructive uncertainty, for example, individuals might be guaranteed a high minimum quality of life, but wouldn’t be guaranteed social structures or institutions in any particular form. Instead, economic, social and other systems would be designed so that they can switch states fluidly, as context demands. This would require a careful balancing act between questions of what’s good and right on the one hand – fairness, equality, equal opportunity – and a commitment to robustness and adaptability on the other. It is a provocative proposal, and experimenting with it, even on a relatively small scale as in healthcare or financial market design, will require wading through a quagmire of philosophical, ethical and technical issues. Yet nature’s success suggests it has potential.</p><p>The human heart confers robustness by beating to a rhythm that’s neither chaotic nor periodic but fractal</p><p>Consider that the human body is remarkably functional given all that could go wrong with its approximately 30 trillion cells (and 38 trillion bacterial cells in the body’s microbiome). Nature keeps things working with two broad classes of strategy. The first ensures that a system will continue to function in the face of disturbances or ‘perturbations’; the second enables a system to reduce uncertainty but allow for change, by letting processes proceed at different timescales.</p><p>The first strategy relies on what are known as robustness mechanisms. They allow systems to continue to operate smoothly even when perturbations damage key components. For example, gene expression patterns are said to be robust if they do not vary in the face of environmental or genetic perturbations such as mutations. There are many mechanisms that make this invariance possible, and much debate about how they work, but we can simplify here to give the basic idea. One example is shadow enhancers: partially redundant DNA sequences that regulate genes and work together to keep gene expression stable when a mutation occurs. Another example is gene duplication in which genes have a backup copy with partial functional overlap. This redundancy can allow the duplicate to compensate if the original gene is damaged.</p><p>Robustness mechanisms can be challenging to build in both natural and engineered systems, because their utility isn’t obvious until something goes wrong. They require anticipating the character of rare but damaging perturbations. Nature nonetheless has discovered a rich repertoire of robustness mechanisms. Reconciliation – making up after fights and restoring relationships to a preconflict baseline – isn’t just a human invention. It’s common throughout the animal kingdom and has been observed in many different species. In a different context, the complex structure of the human heart is thought to confer robustness to perturbations at a wide range of scales by beating to a rhythm that is neither chaotic nor periodic but has a fractal structure. Robust design, in contrast to typical approaches in engineering, focuses on discovering mechanisms that maintain functionality under changing or uncertain environments.</p><p>Nature has another set of tricks up her sleeve. The timescales on which a system’s processes run have critical consequences for its ability to predict and adapt to the future. Prediction is easier when things change slowly – but if things change too slowly, it becomes hard to innovate and respond to change. To solve this paradox, nature builds systems that operate on multiple timescales. Genes change relatively slowly but gene expression is fast. The outcomes of fights in a monkey group change daily but their power structure takes months or years to change. Fast timescales – monkey fights – have more uncertainty, and consequently provide a mechanism for social mobility. Meanwhile, slow timescales – power structures – provide consistency and predictability, allowing individuals to figure out the regularities and develop appropriate strategies.</p><p>The degree of timescale separation between fast and slow dynamics matters too. If there’s a big separation and the power structure changes very slowly, no amount of fight-winning will get a young monkey to the top – even if that monkey, as it gained experience, became a really gifted fighter. A big separation means it will take a long time for ‘real’ information at the individual level – eg, that the young monkey has become a good fighter – to be reflected in the power structure. Hence, if the power structure changes too slowly, although it might guard against meaningless changes at the individual level, it won’t be informative about regularities – about who can actually successfully use force when things, such as the ability of our young monkey, really do change.</p><p>Furthermore, sometimes the environment requires the system as a whole to innovate, but sometimes it demands quiescence. That means there’s a benefit to being able to adjust the degree of timescale separation between the fast and slow processes, depending on whether it’s useful for a change at the ‘bottom’ to be felt at the ‘top’. These points circle us back to our earlier remarks about nonstationarity – the degree of timescale separation is a way of balancing trade-offs caused by different types of nonstationarity in the system.</p><p>The detailed mechanisms by which nature accomplishes timescale separation are still largely unknown and an active area of scientific investigation. However, humans can still take inspiration from the timescale-separation idea. When we design systems of the future, we could build in mechanisms that enable users – such as market engineers and policymakers – to tune the degree of timescale separation or coupling between individual behaviour on the one hand, and institutions or aggregate variables such as stock returns or time in elected office on the other. We have crude versions of this already. Financial markets are vulnerable to crashes because of an inherent lack of timescale separation between trading and stock market indices, such that it’s possible in periods of panic-selling for an index to lose substantial value in a matter of hours. In recognition of this property, market engineers introduced what’s called a ‘circuit breaker’ – a rule for pausing trading when signs of a massive drop are detected. The circuit breaker doesn’t really tune the separation between trades and index performance, though. It simply halts trading when a crash seems likely. A more explicit tuning approach would be to slow down trading during dangerous periods by limiting the magnitude or frequency of trades in a given window, and to allow trading to proceed at will when the environment is more predictable. There are many possible alternative tuning mechanisms; which is best suited to markets is ultimately an empirical question.</p><p>Stock market crashes are a bridge to another of nature’s fascinating properties: the presence of tipping points or critical points, as they’re called in physics. When a system ‘sits’ near a critical point, a small shock can cause a big shift. Sometimes, this means a shift into a new state – a group of fish shoaling (weakly aligned) detects a shark (the shock) and switches to a school formation (highly aligned), which is good for speedy swimming and confusing the predator. These tipping points are often presented in popular articles as something to avoid, for example, when it comes to climate change. But, in fact, as the shark example illustrates, sitting near a critical point can allow a system to adapt appropriately if the environment changes.</p><p>As with timescale separation, tipping points can be useful design features – if distance from them can be modulated. For example, in a recent study of a large, captive monkey society it was found the social system was near a critical point such that a small rise in agitation – perhaps caused by a hot afternoon – could set off a cascade of aggression that would nudge the group from a peaceful state into one in which everyone is fighting. In this group there happened to be powerful individuals who policed conflict, breaking up fights impartially. By increasing or decreasing their frequency of intervention, these individuals could be tuning the group’s sensitivity to perturbations – how far the aggression cascades travel – and thereby tuning distance from the critical point.</p><p>We still don’t know how widespread this sort of tuning is in biological systems. But like degree of timescale separation, it’s something we can build into human systems to make them more fluid and adaptive – and therefore better able to respond to volatility and shocks. In the case of healthcare, that might mean having the financial and technological capacity to build and dismantle temporary treatment facilities at a moment’s notice, perhaps using 3D-printed equipment and biodegradable or reusable materials. In the economy, market corrections that burst bubbles before they get too large serve this function to some extent – they dissipate energy that has built up within the system, but keep the cascade small enough that the market isn’t forced into a crash.</p><p>Climate-change activists warning about tipping points are right to worry. Problems arise when the distance from the critical point can’t be tuned, when individuals make errors (such as incorrectly thinking a shark is present), and when there’s no resilience in the system – that is, no way back to an adaptive state after a system has been disturbed. Irreversible perturbations can lead to complete reconfigurations or total system failure. Reconfiguration might be necessary if the environment has changed, but it will likely involve a costly transition, in that the system will need time and resources to find satisfactory solutions to the new environment. When the world is moderately or very noisy – filled with random, uninformative events – sensitivity to perturbations is dangerous. But it’s useful when a strategic shift is warranted (eg, a predator appears) or when the environment is fundamentally changing and the old tactics simply won’t do.</p><p>One of the many challenges in designing systems that flourish under uncertainty is how to improve the quality of information available in the system. We are not perfect information processors. We make mistakes and have a partial, incomplete view of the world. The same is true of markets, as the investor Bill Miller has pointed out. This lack of individual omniscience can have positive and negative effects. From the system’s point of view, many windows on the world affords multiple independent (or semi-independent) assessments of the environment that provide a form of ‘collective intelligence’. However, each individual would also like a complete view, and so is motivated to copy, share and steal information from others. Copying and observation can facilitate individual learning, but at the same time tends to reduce the independence and diversity that’s valuable for the group as a whole. A commonly cited example is the so-called herd mentality of traders who, in seeing others sell, panic and sell their own shares.</p><p>For emergent engineering to succeed, we need to develop a better understanding of what makes a group intelligent. What we do know is there seem to be two phases or parts of the process – the accumulation phase, in which individuals collect information about how the world works, and the aggregation phase, in which that information is pooled. We also know that if individuals are bad at collecting good information – if they misinterpret data due to their own biases or are overconfident in their assessments – an aggregation mechanism can compensate.</p><p>One example of an aggregation mechanism is the PageRank algorithm used early on in Google searches. PageRank worked by giving more weight to those pages that have many incoming connections from other webpages. Another kind of aggregation mechanism might discount votes of individuals who are prone to come to the same conclusion because they use the same reasoning process, thereby undermining diversity. Or take the US electoral college, which was originally conceived to ‘correct’ the popular vote so that population-dense areas didn’t entirely control election outcomes. If, on the other hand, implementing or identifying good aggregation mechanisms is hard – there are, for example, many good arguments against the electoral college – it might be possible to compensate by investing in improving the information-accumulation capacity of individuals. That way, common cognitive biases such as overconfidence, anchoring and loss-aversion are less likely at first instance. That said, in thinking through how to design aggregation algorithms that optimise for collective intelligence, ethical issues concerning privacy and fairness also present themselves.</p><p>Rather than attempt to precisely predict the future, we have tried to make the case for designing systems that favour robustness and adaptability – systems that can be creative and responsive when faced with an array of possible scenarios. The COVID-19 pandemic provides an unprecedented opportunity to begin to think through how we might harness collective behaviour and uncertainty to shape a better future for us all.

But in Donald Hall’s case, his decades-long relationship with his assistant proved to be a lifeline that extended his writing career.</p><p>When Donald Hall interviewed Kendel Currier for the part-time job of typing his correspondence in August of 1994, one of the first things he asked was, “Will you type curse words?” His earlier hire for the position, a woman active in a local church, backed out when she discovered curse words in a letter, and he wanted to make sure Currier wouldn’t quit, too.</p><p>Hall found Currier’s response reassuring: She would type whatever he dictated, she told him, and keep a dictionary nearby in case she was uncertain of a spelling. She was thirty-six at the time and, by her own description, a stay-at-home mom and housewife. But she’d done secretarial work in the past, and Hall—not quite twice Currier’s age at sixty-six—was impressed by her professionalism. So, he hired her on the spot, and turned up the next day at her house in Andover, New Hampshire, with a canvas bag that contained a model letter, a stack of stationery, and a transcriber for playing back the dictation on his tapes. “It was as if the universe offered me a gift,” Currier later said, “and I was smart enough to accept it.”</p><p>Currier obtained the typewriter she used, an IBM Selectric III, from Hall’s previous typist, Lois Fierro. Lois also offered Currier a couple of tips: Hall insisted on the British spelling “cheque” for a bank check, and spelled “anymore” as two words.</p><p>Soon Hall and his amanuensis fell into their daily rhythm: he drove ten miles to her home in Andover to drop off the tape she was to transcribe with a guide sheet, and she typed up letters for the next day, when he brought her another tape. Because they used two briefcases for their transactions, the two rarely spoke. She would leave her briefcase with its finished work between her storm and front doors, where he could easily exchange it with his briefcase containing new work. Hall came early in the morning, and often, when Currier opened the door, he’d have already come and gone. In a way, she says, “we took up our own correspondence, I typing notes to him, and he answering me on the daily tape.”</p><p>The voice she found on the tapes was hard to get used to at first. “He was a man I didn’t know, and I had to learn how to hear him,” she says. “And there was a lot of background noise, because he often dictated while he was watching a baseball game or driving his car.” But she was immediately impressed by the recipients of his letters. “The first letter I typed for him was to Robert Bly,” she says, “and there were all these other well-known writers.” She gradually realized that the man she was working for was at the center of the American literary scene. He was an enormously prolific correspondent, who dictated ten to twenty letters a day and never let a letter go unanswered.</p><p>A continual theme in Hall’s early dictated letters was his worry about his wife, Jane Kenyon, who was stricken with leukemia. When Currier began in her position in late August, he and Kenyon were waiting for a blood match for a bone-marrow transplant. It was a time of great anxiety. But three weeks after she was hired, they got a call that a match had been found, and they quickly made plans to travel to Seattle for the operation.</p><p>Before they left, Hall set up a system for delivering his daily tapes by mail. He supplied Currier with stationery, envelopes, and money for stamps so she could send his letters back to him for a final proofing. Now he could stay in touch with friends, readers, and professional contacts with only a slight delay in his responses. Currier gradually discovered that Hall’s letter writing had another benefit: it gave him ideas for his creative work. After he repeated the same story from his daily life from one letter to the next, she says, it would sometimes appear in a poem. “I don’t know that he ever spoke or wrote about this,” she reflects, “but I certainly noticed it.”</p><p>Much of the Seattle correspondence Currier typed was about the progress and results of Kenyon’s operation. Early signs showed the transplant had taken, lifting their hopes. But in the weeks after the couple flew home to New Hampshire, her leukemia returned. Hall’s letters were consumed by sorrow. When Kenyon died in late April 1995, friends and readers across the country wrote to share Hall’s grief. “The outpouring of condolence by mail afterward was enormous,” Currier remembers. Hall insisted on answering every correspondent. “It was one of the busiest times I’ve ever had with him,” she says, “typing many, many postcards, notes, and letters.”</p><p>“Don was such a letter writer,” says Currier, “that he went on writing to Jane even after she died.” Hall’s letter-poems to Kenyon appear in his 1998 collection Without and take up nearly half of the volume. Offering spontaneous, intimate news of daily events to a recipient who cannot read them, the poems take us closer to Hall’s heartbreak than any of the more deliberate entries that precede them. They bring a new tone to his work.</p><p>“His grief was all he wrote about in his letters for a year after Jane’s death,” Currier says. As in the past, those letters, too, helped him with his poetry, providing observations and stories he later used in poems. Sometimes, “it worked the other way,” that is, he included in his letters things he’d already written about, as if to test their effect.</p><p>Currier had good reason to know about the links between Hall’s letters and poems. In July of 1996, Sharon Broughton, who typed Hall’s poetry and prose, married and moved to California, and Currier took over her work. So in addition to typing his grief-filled correspondence, she was also typing the poems of Without, draft by draft.</p><p>Currier’s increased responsibilities came at exactly the right time: her son Tyler was about the enter the first grade, freeing her from childcare for a longer part of the day. But there were problems for her at home. “My marriage was pretty bumpy at that point,” she says, and sometimes, when Hall pulled into her driveway to drop off his briefcase of new work, the two of them talked about their personal difficulties, Currier with her husband and Hall with the women he was now dating. They were alike in some ways, both of them without—he having lost his life partner, and she sensing she would soon lose hers as well. And through these unguarded conversations, a bond formed and their relationship deepened.</p><p>In late winter 1998, as her divorce neared, Currier became concerned that she would no longer have a home office to work from and would have to give up her job. She was greatly relieved when Hall stepped in to offer the cottage that once belonged to his grandfather’s hired man.</p><p>The cottage was just seventy yards down the road from Hall’s farmhouse, a much more convenient location than Currier’s house, which required a car ride. With Hall’s blessing, she got a friend to build a desk in the living room large enough to hold a typewriter, a computer, and a copy machine. Over the next several weeks, after she had completed the day’s typing, Hall would meet her at the cottage to unpack and organize the boxes from his mother’s house that had been stored there, boxes of family photographs, mementos, and linens. The process became the impetus for his later memoir, Unpacking the Boxes. In October, after the unpacking was complete, Hall suggested that Currier move in and make the cottage her permanent home.</p><p>Because her new residence was so close to his house, a single briefcase was all the pair needed now for their daily exchanges. When Hall finished dictating in the evening, he left the briefcase outside his house in a porch chair. Next morning, before the sun came up, Currier collected the briefcase, and returned it in the late morning, full of letters and manuscripts. “I became known as ‘that woman who carries a briefcase on Route 4 in the dark,’ ” she says. Sometimes she checked the farmhouse through her north window just to make sure things were as they should be—the lights on or not on, depending on the time of day, the car in the driveway where it belonged. Like the hired man who had lived in the cottage before her, she began attending to the rhythms of the main house.</p><p>The essential rhythm between author and amanuensis, the exchange of the briefcase, altered as time went on, moving later into the day. They developed a visual code. Currier was to watch for the briefcase from her window, and when it appeared on its porch chair, she would know her day’s work awaited. When she finished the work, she carried the briefcase back to its chair and placed it on its side, so Hall would understand that its contents were ready for inspection.</p><p>By the middle of 1999, Hall had assigned Currier an assortment of new chores—she’d become a trusted partner. She helped clear away Jane Kenyon’s clothes. She alphabetically shelved the new poetry books he received and sorted family photographs. Then Hall turned over all his bookkeeping to her, and when he traveled, put her in charge of his house to deal with his mail, faxes, phone messages, and the care of his pets. She even drove him to poetry readings around New Hampshire and well outside the state. In his letters and prose, Hall took to calling her his assistant.</p><p>For years, Currier had happily conformed her life and schedule to Hall’s, but now there was something she needed to do for herself. She wanted to go to college. Back in high school, when she’d brought up the subject of college to her parents, they were puzzled. Why would she waste her money on that, her father asked, since she’d be following her husband’s lead wherever he went? Ultimately, her parents relented, but only if she agreed to take up something practical. She chose a program in business and science at the University of Rhode Island, but only made it through introductory courses before she dropped out from lack of interest. In the fall of 1999, she enrolled in the adult education program offered by the University of New Hampshire. Then she selected courses in the humanities and began to learn about the world of literature, art, and thought.</p><p>In hindsight, Currier sees how much Hall influenced the curriculum she chose. “Working for someone whose life was literature was an eye-opening experience,” she says. “I was exposed to new ideas through Don, and I got to expand them by going back to school.” When she had extra homework, Hall adjusted her schedule, occasionally giving her whole days off to catch up. “He believed in higher education,” Currier says, “and he wanted me to have it.”</p><p>By his example, Hall also taught her how to write. During her time as a student, he was working on The Best Day the Worst Day, his prose memoir about his life with Kenyon, and Currier was impressed by his discipline and his pursuit of perfection. “He wrote the entire book in longhand three times,” she recalls, and after she typed up the third version, he scribbled revisions for retyping in the margins. “He would change a passage twenty times, and I’d say to myself, Oh my God, Don, please don’t change that again! But the twentieth time it would be so much better.” Guided by Hall’s passion for revision, Currier won high praise for her own written work; one professor even asked to use her final paper as a model in future classes.</p><p>In the spring of 2003, when Currier crossed the stage in her cap and gown to receive her degree, she heard her son shout from the audience “Way to go, Mom!” That same year Hall asked if he could dedicate a book of essays to her, Breakfast Served Any Time All Day, which she’d just finished typing. Currier was flattered, and surprised, too, though on reflection she surmised the reason for his dedication. As she typed the book, her admiration for it grew, and she told Hall that his essays about writing poetry would be helpful to anyone who wanted to write.</p><p>Still, she wasn’t sure about the book’s title, she told Hall, because she thought it had nothing to do with the content. He responded by editing his opening essay to explain the title. It was her college degree, she says, that gave her the confidence to tell him what didn’t sound right to her in his work, both in that manuscript and in others that came after. Her degree also gave her a different attitude when she sat in Hall’s audience after driving him to a poetry reading. She felt, she says, “more like I belonged there.”</p><p>Currier sent her question about the title of Breakfast Served Any Time All Day through their regular channel for communication: notes sent back and forth in the daily briefcase—he dictating his notes to her, and she typing a comment or question. In this way, Currier also told him about her multiple sclerosis. Since her disease had not interfered with her typing, she’d had no need to discuss it with him. But in the manuscript of a short story he was working on, one of his characters died of MS, and she was compelled to explain that people don’t generally die of MS. Then she had to explain how she knew.</p><p>In the first decade of the 2000s, Currier’s MS steadily progressed. First, she wore a brace on her left foot, then she began to use a cane. A few years later she graduated to a rollator walker. Today, she gets around on a disability scooter. In 2007, she began to type with voice recognition software because she was losing function in the little and ring fingers of her left hand— “a and s,” she says, “are very important letters.”</p><p>By that time, Hall had his own disabilities to deal with, the result of old age and a lifelong aversion to physical exercise. In his prose book, Essays After Eighty, he confesses his immobility: “I sit on my ass all day writing in longhand, which Kendel types up.” Five years earlier, in Unpacking the Boxes, he described how hard it was to raise himself out of his living room chair, a problem eventually solved by a mechanical lift.</p><p>Currier remembers how often Hall fell. One morning in winter, as she checked the farmhouse from her north window, she noticed his car had been warming up for a long time. When she went up to check, she found Hall lying in the driveway beside the car, unable to get up. Another day, as she entered the house, she heard him calling out in panic from the floor on the far side of his bed. Unable to lift him because of her own disability, she talked him into a position from which he could get himself up. On later falls, when he couldn’t manage to lift himself, she called the local fire department for assistance. Her list of responsibilities continued to grow; it now included the role of safeguard and protector.</p><p>In 2008, during the period of his falling, Hall got into his second car accident. Nobody was hurt, but he lost his license. This made it easier for Currier to keep an eye on him throughout each day, when she brought him his breakfast sandwich and Boston Globe and picked up the briefcase for work. Always the two of them talked a bit in the morning, and longer in the afternoon, when she brought her typed pages back to him and he’d finished his writing for the day. Sometimes the subject was their mutual disability. Currier told him about the benefits of getting around on a rollator, and once, after she began to use a scooter, Hall suggested she might one day want a grabber like the one his daughter Philippa bought him for grasping things beyond his reach.</p><p>Currier didn’t know about grabbers, and she appreciated the thought. Still, the most important way Hall helped her with her disability was simply by understanding. “He told me how horrible and unfair it was that I had MS,” she says, “and he was always very concerned about it.” For her part, she sympathized with him about the growing troubles of old age. Once, when he was depressed by his infirmities, she counseled him to try and see things differently, as she had learned to do with her MS, accepting life as it actually was, and finding the good in what might seem a hopeless situation. Hall was determined that people couldn’t change their feelings, and her advice never took. But the life she led by example did. He understood, she says, “that my sympathy was limited because I had my own disability. He knew he couldn’t play the disability card with me.”</p><p>Currier was not the only woman who looked after Hall in his eighties. There were several such women, and the locals had a nickname for them. Linda Kunhardt, the love of his life after Kenyon died, discovered the nickname when she dropped off some of Hall’s mail at the post office in Danbury, New Hampshire, and a clerk asked her if she was part of “Hall’s Harem.” The members of the group are listed in the dedication of Hall’s last book, A Carnival of Losses: his housekeeper, his personal trainer, two women who delivered his mail and his prescriptions, and, at the very top of the list, Currier, his all-purpose assistant, and by then, his dear and trusted friend.</p><p>Unlike the other helpers, Currier emerges in A Carnival of Losses and Essays After Eighty as a constant companion, a fully developed character who’s not afraid to pull rank when it comes to Hall’s best interests. She was especially worried by his smoking. In a passage from “No Smoking,” Hall relates that she once noticed “the carpet between my chair and a low bookshelf was burned away, as were the backs of some books.” When he explained that the damage came from a lost, burning cigarette, Currier was horrified and refused to leave the farmhouse until he promised to call her whenever he couldn’t locate a dropped cigarette. In the same essay, Hall describes the two of them on their way to New York City, Currier driving and he occasionally cracking his window to smoke. “Somewhere around Springfield, Massachusetts,” he writes, when he took out another cigarette, Currier parked the car and asked him to smoke outside. “I could not smoke in my own car,” Hall writes. “Kendel is kind, but Kendel is a hard case.”</p><p>The affection and respect Hall felt served Currier well in the period after he finished Essays after Eighty, when his mood turned dark. He was discouraged, not only because he didn’t have a subject to write about, but because even if he did, he wouldn’t have enough energy to manage the job. Watching him adrift, day after day, made Currier unhappy as well. She finally told him, “If you don’t work, I don’t work.” Those words “seemed to shock him a bit,” she says, “because I don’t think he’d ever thought about the impact he might be having on me.” Afterward she pleaded with him to “write anything, whether it was publishable or not, just to get writing again.” At her urging, he began the short essays of A Carnival of Losses—“notes,” as he called them, each tailored to fit his reduced periods of concentration.</p><p>The glaring exception to shortness is the essay “Necropoetics,” over twenty pages concerning Jane Kenyon’s influence on his poetry after her death. The essay was long enough and important enough for Hall that he gave it the prominence of its own section in the book. It was Currier who urged him to write the piece, first reading his thoughts about the theme of necropoetics in his letters, then prompting him, repeatedly, to explore them during afternoon chats. There’s little doubt that her encouragement was crucial not only to the creation of “Necropoetics,” but to Hall’s last volume itself.</p><p>Not long after he completed A Carnival of Losses, Donald Hall died. The memorial service, held in the South Danbury church, took place nearly two years ago.</p><p>Currier still lives in the small farmhand’s cottage, but the farmhouse, now empty, has been sold to a hastily formed group whose stated purpose is to preserve it. Currier now awaits the results of an application she has made to a nearby retirement community, and she has joined a counseling group to deal with the grief she feels. “I cannot look up there every day knowing that Don’s not there,” she says, “knowing there’s no reason to look anymore.”</p><p>But she has her memories. She recalls, for instance, the times she surprised Hall with results from her online research: biographies of poets he knew as a young man for his “Selected Poets of Donald Hall” section in A Carnival of Losses, or an early photograph of himself with an apple in his mouth, which she persuaded him to reprint with his essay “Dictating the Pig.” She remembers moments when he asked for her thoughts about a word or a piece he had written. She remembers especially how he honored her with his dedication for Breakfast Served Any Time All Day.</p><p>And of course Currier has the memory of her daily journeys with their shared briefcase, in all weather, from her cottage to Hall’s farmhouse and back again for more than twenty years, first in the dark on foot, sometimes in the winter on cross-country skis, and during her last years riding on her disability scooter, the briefcase tucked behind her legs under the seat. By that time the case showed signs of its continuous repair. “At first when the stitching at the seams came undone,” Currier says, “I would hand-sew it back together.” Later, as she lost the use of her left hand, she repaired the briefcase with duct tape. The record of its restorations honors the commitment of the two people who spent their life together, filling and emptying it.</p><p>Currier’s last official day as Hall’s amanuensis was in the fall of 2019. She closed down his email account. She deleted his emails from her private account, along with his remaining Word files. Then she sent in her final pay numbers to his accountant. With a few keystrokes, “I let go of what I’d continued to hold onto since Don died. It was far more emotional than I expected.”</p><p>Before Hall’s son, Andrew, and daughter, Philippa, dealt with the contents of their father’s farmhouse, they asked his housekeeper, his personal trainer, and Currier if there was anything each of them would like to have. Without hesitation, Kendel Currier requested Donald Hall’s grabber. He had told her there might come a day when she would need a way to grasp things beyond her reach. She needed it now. “Every time I use this grabber,” she says, “I find myself thanking him.”</p><p>Wesley McNair is the author of more than twenty books, including the recent poetry collections The Unfastening and The Lost Child: Ozark Poems, winner of the 2015 PEN New England Award for Literary Excellence in Poetry.

The Oliver Room, home to the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh’s rare books and archives, was something close to the platonic ideal of this concept. Greg Priore, manager of the room starting in 1992, designed it that way.</p><p>The room has a single point of entry, and only a few people had keys to it. When anyone, employee or patron, entered the collection, Priore wanted to know. The room had limited daytime hours, and all guests were required to sign in and leave personal items, like jackets and bags, in a locker outside. Activity in the room was under constant camera surveillance.</p><p>In addition, the Oliver Room had Priore himself. His desk sat at a spot that commanded the room and the table where patrons worked. When a patron returned a book, he checked that it was still intact. Security for special collections simply does not get much better than that of the Oliver Room.</p><p>In the spring of 2017, then, the library’s administration was surprised to find out that many of the room’s holdings were gone. It wasn’t just that a few items were missing. It was the most extensive theft from an American library in at least a century, the value of the stolen objects estimated to be $8 million.</p><p>There are two types of people who frequent special collections that are open to the public: scholars who want to study something in particular, and others who just want to see something interesting. Both groups are often drawn to incunables. Books printed at the dawn of European movable type, between 1450 and 1500, incunables are old, rare and historically important. In short, an incunable is so valued and usually such a prominent holding that any thief who wanted to avoid detection would not steal one. The Oliver Room thief stole ten.</p><p>Visitors and researchers alike love old maps, and few are more impressive than those in Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, commonly known as the Blaeu Atlas. The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh’s version, printed in 1644, originally comprised three volumes containing 276 hand-colored lithographs that mapped the known world in the age of European exploration. All 276 maps were missing.</p><p>Many of the library’s holdings had been donated over the years by the founder, Andrew Carnegie, and his friends. But in one notable instance, the library allotted money specifically to purchase 40 volumes of photogravure prints of Native Americans created by Edward Curtis in the first decades of the 20th century. The images were beautiful, historically valuable and extremely rare. Only 272 sets were created; in 2012, Christie’s sold one set for $2.8 million. The Carnegie Library’s set held some 1,500 photogravure “plates”—illustrations made apart from a book and inserted into it. They had all been cut and removed from their bindings, “except a few scattered throughout of unremarkable subjects,” a book expert later noted.</p><p>And this was just the beginning. The person who worked over the Oliver Room stole nearly everything of significant monetary value, sparing no country or century or subject. He took the oldest book in the collection, a collection of sermons printed in 1473, and also the most recognizable book, a first edition of Isaac Newton’s 98. He stole a first edition of The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith, a letter written by William Jennings Bryan and a rare copy of Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s 1898 memoir, Eighty Years and More: Reminiscences 1815-1897. He stole a first edition of a book written by the nation’s second president, John Adams, as well as a book signed by the third, Thomas Jefferson. He stole the first English edition of Giovanni Boccaccio’s Decameron, printed in London in 1620, and the first edition of George Eliot’s Silas Marner, printed in the same city 241 years later. From John James Audubon’s 1851-54 Quadrupeds of North America, he stole 108 of the 155 hand-colored lithographs.</p><p>In short, he took nearly everything he could get his hands on. And he did it with impunity for close to 25 years.</p><p>When a library finds that it has been the victim of a major theft, it can take a long time to determine what is missing; an inspection of each shelved item and its pages is a laborious process. But the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh’s rare and antiquarian collection had already been well documented, ever since the administration moved to establish an archive of the institution’s rarest holdings. Greg Priore, who had graduated with an M.A. in European history a few years earlier from nearby Duquesne University, was then working in the library’s Pennsylvania Room, a space dedicated to local history and genealogy. He was also pursuing a library science degree at the University of Pittsburgh, with an emphasis on archives management. Both on paper and in person, he seemed like the perfect candidate to run the new archive, and was hired in 1991 to oversee what became the Oliver Room collection in 1992.</p><p>Priore comes across as professional but easygoing, the sort of guy who knows a lot but wears his knowledge lightly. Just under six feet tall, with a resonant voice and a prominent mustache, he was the son of a local obstetrician and spent the bulk of his life within walking distance of the Carnegie Library. An important job at a prestigious institution in his home city was something like a dream.</p><p>After getting the job, he worked alongside a preservation specialist to assess the Carnegie Library’s rare and antiquarian books. In addition, two rare book experts hired to offer conservation advice found that the library had given little thought to preserving its oldest books. So the staff blocked off windows to get control of the climate, substituted metal shelves for the old ones made of wood, which can leach acid into books, and upgraded the security system. In 1992, the room was officially renamed for William R. Oliver, a longtime benefactor. For years it served as the jewel of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. Docents took patrons on tours, and C-SPAN said it was one of western Pennsylvania’s cultural high points. Scholars and journalists plumbed its archives.</p><p>In the fall of 2016, library officials decided it was time to audit the collection again, and hired the Pall Mall Art Advisors to do the appraisal. Kerry-Lee Jeffrey and Christiana Scavuzzo began their audit on April 3, 2017, a Monday, using the 1991 inventory as a guide. Within an hour, there was trouble. Jeffrey was looking for Thomas McKenney and James Hall’s History of the Indian Tribes of North America. This landmark work included 120 hand-colored lithographs, the result of a project that began in 1821 with McKenney’s attempt to document in full color the dress and spiritual practices of Native Americans who had visited Washington, D.C. to arrange treaties with the government. The three-volume set of folios, produced between 1836 and 1844, is large and gorgeous and would be a highlight in any collection. But the Carnegie Library’s version had been hidden on a top shelf at the end of a row. When Jeffrey discovered why, her stomach dropped. “Once a plump book filled with plates,” she would recall, “the sides had caved in on themselves.” All those stunning illustrations had been cut from the binding.</p><p>The appraisers discovered that many of the invaluable books with illustrations or maps had been ransacked. John Ogilby’s America—one of the greatest illustrated English works about the New World, printed in London in 1671—had contained 51 plates and maps. They were gone. A copy of Ptolemy’s groundbreaking La Geographia, printed in 1548, had survived intact for over 400 years, but now all of its maps were missing. Of an 18-volume set of Giovanni Piranesi’s extremely rare etchings, printed between 1748 and 1807, the assessors noted dryly, “The only part of this asset located during on-site inspection was its bindings. The contents have evidently been removed from the bindings and the appraiser is taking the extraordinary assumption that they have been removed from the premises.” The replacement value for the Piranesis alone was $600,000.</p><p>Everywhere they looked, the auditors found a staggering degree of destruction and looting. They showed their results to the head of the Preservation Department, Jacalyn Mignogna. She, too, felt sick. After seeing historic volume after historic volume reduced to stubs, she went back to her office and wept. On April 7, only five days after the appraisers had begun their inquiry, Jeffrey and Scavuzzo met with the library’s director, Mary Frances Cooper, and two other administrators, and detailed what they had already found—or, rather, not found. The next phase of their analysis would have a more pessimistic focus: Now they would try to determine just how far the collection’s value had fallen. On April 11, a Tuesday, Cooper had the lock to the Oliver Room changed. Greg Priore was not given a key.</p><p>Just about the only thing that keeps an insider from stealing from special collections is conscience. Security measures may thwart outside thieves, but if someone wants to steal from the collection he stewards, there is little to stop him. Getting books and maps and lithographs out the door is not much harder than simply taking them from the shelves.</p><p>While other cultural heritage thieves have gone to great lengths to avoid calling attention to their acts—stealing items of low value, destroying card catalog entries, ripping out bookplates, bleaching library stamps from pages—Priore took the best stuff he could find, and brazenly left the library stamps in, as the library would see when it began to regather the books. Despite this cavalier approach, he was astonishingly successful, more successful than any insider book thief in memory.</p><p>Priore and his wife, who worked as a children’s librarian, hardly had an opulent lifestyle; the couple lived in a modest apartment crowded with books. But they had four children, who attended private schools: St. Edmund’s Academy, the Ellis School and Duquesne University.</p><p>All indications suggest that he was perpetrating his crimes not to get rich but rather, as he told police, merely to stay “afloat.” For example, in the fall of 2015, Priore wrote an email to the Ellis School asking for an extension on tuition payments. “I am trying to juggle tuition payments for 4 kids,” he wrote. A few weeks later, he asked Duquesne officials to lift a hold on accounts assigned to two of his children, since he had made overdue tuition payments. In February 2016, Priore asked his landlord for an extension, falsely claiming his wife had missed work because of a heart attack. The rent was four months past due.</p><p>Priore lived close enough to the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh that he could walk to work in 15 minutes. One route took him past the famous blue edifice of the Caliban Book Shop, one of the city’s best-known cultural spots. The store was founded in 1991 by a Pittsburgher named John Schulman, who is 5 feet 7 inches tall and stocky, with close-trimmed, thinning gray hair and, often, a graying goatee blending into a few days’ growth of beard.</p><p>Schulman started his bookselling business in the 1980s, working out of a Pittsburgh apartment. Gregarious and diligent, he acquired the sort of status that comes from years of reputable work in the profession. He was a member of the Antiquarian Booksellers’ Association of America (ABAA), serving on its board of governors for the Mid-Atlantic chapter. He was also an appraiser for regional institutions, including the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University and Penn State. After decades selling rare books, he was familiar to most in the business and even somewhat well known outside of it: Thanks to appearances on “Antiques Roadshow,” he was PBS-famous.</p><p>For the most part, Schulman treated the books, maps or prints that Priore brought him exactly as he would process the rare and antiquarian materials he got from any source. He would describe an individual book in ways people in the market would understand and, depending on the quality of an item, list it on his website. But with the items Priore brought, there was an added step.</p><p>When a book of value or importance is acquired by a library, the institution marks it using one of several different kinds of stamp: ink, emboss or perforation. These marks, which state the name of the library, are meant to do two things: identify the rightful owner and destroy the value of the book for resale. Most major special collections, like the Oliver Room, also adhere a bookplate to the inside front cover.</p><p>To sell such a heavily marked book, a typical thief would have to tear, cut and bleach away this evidence; if he was not careful, he would destroy in the process much of what made the book valuable in the first place. Schulman found another way to ready a stolen book for sale. Using materials he kept at his store, whenever he got a Carnegie book from Priore, he or one of his employees pressed a small red stamp, bright as lipstick, on the bottom of the bookplate. It pronounced the book “Withdrawn from Library.” That mark was to counteract the others.</p><p>While there is a tradition of librarians and archivists stealing from collections they are meant to steward, not since the 1930s had a dealer as highly reputed as Schulman been implicated. In the 1970s and ’80s, a flamboyant Texas bookman and one-time president of the ABAA named John Jenkins made money selling stolen and forged items to libraries and collectors. But most of his malfeasance was confined to Texas—and no one who knew Jenkins would have been surprised to discover he was an outlaw. He was an indebted gambler who had burned his own store for insurance money, and his life ended in 1989 with a gunshot to the head (authorities differ over whether it was a homicide or a suicide).</p><p>Schulman, a constant presence at the major book fairs, seemed as rock-solid as any bookseller in the business—all of which made him the perfect fence for Priore. The librarian could not risk approaching dealers or collectors directly with the types of books he was selling, and the internet would have exposed him the first time he tried to sell an incunable. Priore simply could not have operated without Schulman’s help and good name—and Schulman could not have gained access to the Oliver Room’s big-ticket items without Priore.</p><p>Apparently Greg Priore knew he was about to get caught six months before it happened. In the fall of 2016, when the library administration was discussing the possibility of an appraisal of the Oliver Room—which would necessarily uncover missing assets—he argued against it. But his colleagues chalked it up to his general obstinacy against having others in his domain, an obstinacy that one librarian noted had grown increasingly pronounced as the years ticked by. Still, with or without Priore’s approval, the administration decided to go ahead with the assessment.</p><p>Priore talked to Schulman about it, and the bookseller tried to help his supplier by emailing a number of possible explanations for why many items were missing. Some items might be out for repair or loan, Schulman offered, urging Priore to create documents attesting to this. He also suggested saying the library’s former director, now dead, had talked about selling off some of the Oliver Room’s better books, and that he might have done so while Priore was away on leave. And Schulman proposed emphasizing “that the Oliver Room is fairly porous and accessible...[and] that there have no doubt been multiple opportunities for many different staff and visitors to enter the rooms without proper protocol.”</p><p>For his part, Priore suggested that the room’s defenses weren’t perfect. When library administrators interviewed him on April 18, 2017, he told Cooper, the director, that he did leave catalogers, interns and volunteers to work by themselves in the room. He added that maintenance workers—in particular, some men who had done repairs to the roof—had access to the room.</p><p>In the end, though, there was no way to hide his decades of crimes. Thousands of plates, maps and photographs were missing; clearly, this was not the work of a patron or workman who had enjoyed a few minutes’ unfettered access. Even if someone else had been stealing from the library, it would have been impossible for Priore not to notice so much was missing. In April he was suspended from his job and in June he was fired.</p><p>Pittsburgh police began a formal investigation in June, and on August 24 executed search warrants at Priore’s home, the Caliban Book Shop and a Caliban warehouse. Police questioned Priore the same day. It didn’t take long for him to come clean.</p><p>When police went to the Caliban warehouse, they brought along Christiana Scavuzzo of Pall Mall Art Advisors. She found, among other items, 91 of the Edward Curtis prints and seven maps from the Blaeu Atlas. Police also found the stamp that Schulman used to indicate that the books he sold had been deaccessioned from the library.</p><p>Bill Claspy is twice a graduate of Case Western Reserve University, with a B.A. and an M.A. in English literature, and today serves as head of special collections for the university’s main library. Despite his love for the humanities, he knows it is the sciences that keep the lights on at Case Western. That’s why he was especially sad to surrender an important book of scientific history.</p><p>In August 2018, he received an email from Lyle Graber, a detective in the Allegheny County District Attorney’s office in Pennsylvania, about a recently purchased book of early modern astronomy. “While reviewing evidence in this case,” Graber wrote, “it appears that in 2016 you purchased Quaestiones in Theoricas in Georgii Purbachii from...Caliban Books. Unfortunately, it is very possible that this book is among those having been stolen from the Carnegie Library and sold to unsuspecting buyers such as yourself.”</p><p>Schulman’s catalog description noted the book’s condition was “very good with minor ex-library marks.” Claspy retrieved the book from its shelf and saw what Schulman meant by “ex-library marks”: The first two pages had several stamps and an ash-blue rectangular bookplate from the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. Below the bookplate was a small set of red letters pronouncing the book “Withdrawn from Library.” Claspy carefully wrapped the book and sent it back to Pennsylvania.</p><p>Around the same time, a private collector named Michael Kiesel also received an alarming letter. Kiesel had purchased one of the incunables that Priore had stolen and Schulman had sold to a reputable dealer in England. That dealer asked Kiesel to return the book to Detective Graber, which Kiesel did.</p><p>Dozens of people—private collectors, librarians and rare book dealers—received similar letters that August. They sent the books and documents to Allegheny County, where they have become part of a small but extremely valuable library under the supervision of the district attorney.</p><p>This past January in an Allegheny County court, Priore pleaded guilty to theft and receiving stolen property, while Schulman pleaded guilty to receiving stolen property, theft by deception and forgery. The guidelines for such crimes recommend a standard sentence of nine to 16 months’ incarceration but include two other possibilities: an aggravated range of up to 25 months’ incarceration, and a mitigated range that could include probation.</p><p>Much of what governs sentencing in property crimes comes down to the numbers. The Pall Mall Art Advisors spent months determining the replacement value for each item Priore had destroyed or stolen outright. The total, they concluded, was more than $8 million. But even this number, they said, was inadequate, since many items were irreplaceable—not available for purchase anywhere at any price.</p><p>Claspy argued that the value of rare books, maps and archival documents cannot be measured by money alone. “This crime was not just a crime against my library, or the Carnegie Library, it was a cultural heritage crime against us all,” he wrote to the judge. The director of the University of Pittsburgh Libraries, Kornelia Tancheva, wrote that a rare book theft, “especially from a public library, is an egregious crime against the integrity of the cultural record and against the public good.”</p><p>Further, the Pall Mall Art advisers wondered what books might have been donated to the library in the future, benefiting the people of Pittsburgh, if Greg Priore had not devastated the library’s reputation as well as its holdings. The chilling effect on donors is one reason that many libraries, upon discovering losses from their collections, keep the matter quiet.</p><p>More than two dozen people wrote letters asking the judge, Alexander Bicket, to impose strict sentences—not always a certainty in crimes involving thefts from a library. At an in-person sentencing on June 18, where Priore apologized for his thefts (“I am deeply sorry for what I have done,” he said), several spoke about the terrible effects of these crimes. “We do not want an apology,” Cooper told the judge. “Any apology from these thieves would be meaningless. They are only sorry that we discovered what they did.” Still, Judge Bicket was not swayed. He sentenced Greg Priore to three years’ house arrest and 12 years’ probation. Schulman received four years’ house arrest and 12 years’ probation. Both Schulman and Priore, through representatives, declined to speak to Smithsonian.</p><p>After the sentences were made public, Carole Kamin, a member of the board of the Carnegie Natural History Museum, wrote to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that supporters of local nonprofits “were appalled at the unbelievably light sentences.”</p><p>Numerous booksellers have told me that they believe in Schulman’s innocence, saying he was duped—a view the bookseller himself encouraged in an email to colleagues before the sentencing, in which he insisted he pleaded guilty only to save legal costs and put the matter behind him.</p><p>Others in the rare book world, though, say the evidence gathered by police was convincing. For instance, Schulman did engage in legitimate business with the Carnegie Library over the years, and on those occasions when he purchased a book through proper channels, he wrote checks payable to the library. But when he bought books from Priore, he made the checks payable to Priore—or paid cash.</p><p>It was Schulman’s responsibility, as one bookseller told me, to notice there was something odd about the treasures Priore was handing over. The ethics code of the Antiquarian Booksellers’ Association of America states that members “shall make all reasonable efforts to ascertain that materials offered to him or her are the property of the seller,” and members “shall make every effort to prevent the theft or distribution of stolen antiquarian books and related materials.” Schulman was not only a member of the ABAA. He had served on its ethics and standards committee.</p>\",\"date\":\"2020-8-21\",\"link\":\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/theft-carnegie-library-books-maps-artworks-180975506/\",\"discrp\":\"Over 25 years, almost every book and map of value vanished from the Carnegie Library.

Before Miles Davis went electric and Ornette Coleman bloomed, Brubeck was the surest name to start an argument. A cynical section of the jazz audience perceived his experimental nature as a search for a catchy idiom that might eventually bring him the triumph of a hit. And of course, this line of argument claimed a win when “Take Five” propelled the world onto the dance floor in 5/4 time.</p><p>Those poisonous atmospheres have largely dissipated now, so Philip Clark’s biography comes as a well-timed burst of clarity, except perhaps in the matter of form. Having learnt from Brubeck the art of obliging his public to take him on his own terms rather than see their usual expectations fulfilled, Clark has produced a book so oddly constructed that we arrive at the statement “David Warren Brubeck was born on December 6th 1920, in the small town of Concord, California” on page 302. There may be a smidgeon of bravado in that placement, but the author can hardly be blamed for prioritizing the ten days he spent in and around the Brubeck band bus on its tour of Britain in 2003, collecting the leader’s testimony, which was both frank and copious. I interviewed Brubeck a couple of times, once at some length, and I can’t remember a more obliging conversationalist, with one’s every suggestion properly weighed and no subject off limits. So Clark’s tapes succeed in setting all kinds of themes in motion, and taking us into his hero’s long and controversial career.</p><p>At the same time, some important information is too long postponed. Brubeck’s personality, both stubborn and accommodating, seems hard to decode until we belatedly meet his mother, Elizabeth Ivey “Bessie” Brubeck. Married to the professional outdoorsman Pete, a horse-borne cattle rancher, Bessie harboured ambitions to be a concert pianist. And these were not merely dreams. After having her three sons, she actually took off to London to be tutored by Tobias Matthay, Professor at the Royal Academy of Music, and his pupil, the future Dame Myra Hess. It was Myra who eventually terminated her studies with the words, “Bessie, go home to your children”. That was no doubt a realistic judgement, but Bessie’s hurt was compounded soon after, when Pete agreed to manage an enormous but isolated ranch far out in the Californian hinterland, away from the centres of music and culture generally. “I work and play my part”, she wrote in 1939, “but I am glad that each day brings me nearer the end of my disappointing life.” Her son read that reaction and copied it into his own unpublished memoir – and suddenly one can see where he acquired his fanatical resolve and determination not to be crushed by circumstance. He became his own man, to the extent where the record producer Teo Macero said he didn’t always find working with Dave “most pleasant”, because “he never wanted to take too much advice”. Of course it’s always possible that Macero gave too much of it.</p><p>It may have been his mother’s flirtation with musical celebrity, or her ambition working through young Dave, but he was certainly not intimidated by the greats of his own day. Never a good sight-reader, he could nonetheless write music, and offered sample fragments of composition to notables as unalike as Stan Kenton, the dissonance-friendly bandleader (“Bring it back in ten years”) and the relatively unwelcoming Arnold Schoenberg (“I got out of there fast”, Brubeck recalled). But it was the French composer Darius Milhaud, a member of Les Six, who became Brubeck’s major influence when he took up a post at Mills College in Oakland, California. Brubeck had barely survived the revelation of his weakness at reading, but his other talents, especially in the fashioning of counterpoint, saved him. From Milhaud, a jazz fan since his visit to Harlem in 1922, Brubeck acquired new and sustaining obsessions: polyrhythms and, more immediately, polytonality, the simultaneity of different keys. His 1946 Octet was already using these notions, and Clark is keen to show that the group comfortably predated the famous Miles Davis Nonet, the Birth of the Cool band, which some observers accused him of trying to emulate.</p><p>In any case, the two men were on different tracks entirely. Davis progressed through bebop, which Brubeck knew about – his group toured alongside Charlie Parker’s in 1953 – but took no part in. To jazz listeners and critics for whom bop had become the approved and obvious pathway to the future, that put him on the outside of a large and forbidding fence, the border of those badlands where only non-swinging, pseudo-classical music thrived. Curiously, it was Charles Mingus – bop-literate but not defined by that vocabulary – who pointed out the injustice of that banishment in an “Open Letter to Miles Davis” for Downbeat magazine. “He feels a certain pulse and plays a certain pulse which gives him pleasure and a sense of exaltation because he’s sincerely doing something the way he, Dave Brubeck, feels like doing it.” As for not swinging, Mingus pointed out, Brubeck “had the whole house patting its feet and even clapping its hands” at the Newport Jazz Festival.</p><p>By then, Brubeck had settled on the quartet format that would serve him so well. Clark takes us through the many permutations of personnel which led up to the famous team of Brubeck, Paul Desmond on alto sax, Joe Morello, drums, and Gene Wright, bass – Wright an African American whose inclusion brought out the best of Brubeck’s tenacity in resisting any and every racist call for his eviction from the line-up. Acute during tours of the Southern states, the race-mix problem was by no means confined to those territories. Even on NBC TV’s Bell Telephone Hour, a producer deliberately kept Wright out of shot, a ploy noticed by Brubeck, who withdrew the group from the show at once. They were replaced – a detail underlining the stupidity of it all – by Duke Ellington. A vital educational moment underlay Brubeck’s stance on these matters: the day his father, Pete, had taken him to meet the first Black man he ever saw. Pete invited the man to open his shirt, and there on his chest was the mark of a brand. “These things can’t happen”, Pete said. Brubeck’s eyes filled with tears when he told this story.</p><p>In the heyday of the Quartet, and of his saxophone sound, Paul Desmond was widely regarded as a kind of delicious vanilla sauce decanted over the crunchy stuff Brubeck provided at the piano. But in person, Desmond was not so smooth. Early in their acquaintance, he and the leader did not get on – Desmond was at one stage barred from entering the Brubeck home – and later, a growing appetite for alcohol and raffish night-life made him difficult to manage. In many respects, Desmond was different from Brubeck, who, for example, remained married to the same woman for seventy years. And yet in live performance especially, the two men shared many moments of musical fulfilment where an ecstatic can’t-go-wrong vitality took over their partnership.</p><p>Their signature piece “Take Five” took a long time to reach that carefree stage, and the difficulties the quartet initially experienced with its materials – provided in fragmentary form by Desmond, then unified by Brubeck – make up one of the book’s best passages. But before long, experiments with time-signatures became a habit, through albums like Time Out and Time Further Out, with their famously modish modern-art covers. Many listeners enjoyed the voyage of discovery, others heard only novelty taking the place of inspiration. Either way, it was scarcely unnatural for jazz to seek a world beyond 4/4 time. Even King Oliver, in the 1920s, recorded one waltz. If Brubeck had a fault here, it was in presenting these ventures in too helpful and welcoming a form. A track like the original “Unsquare Dance” is almost a demonstration piece for 7/4 time – and no tidy-minded tape editor, by the way, should be allowed to fade out or chop off Joe Morello’s chuckle of satisfaction as the resolution is reached, even if Brubeck’s piano ending does fall over itself a bit. As Bing Crosby used to say whenever someone pointed out a fault on a recording of his, “It shows I’m human”.</p><p>We are told that Philip Clark lives with his family “and more recorded music than he can ever listen to”. Brubeck’s music alone might account for such overflow. His output of albums became prodigious, and Clark manages to steer us descriptively through most it. Though it is a muscle he over-exercises, his talent for putting sounds into words will send many readers scurrying around the audio-hoards of the internet to hear how, say, this version of “Lover” might strike the ear: “Phrasing around Dodge’s insistent pulse, Brubeck, Desmond and Bates played Richard Rogers’s [sic] theme in 3/4 time. The mathematical permutations of 3/4 interlocking with 4/4 – adding up to ever-changing patterns of strong and weak beats colliding and rebounding against each other – floated the piece free from any single anchoring beat”. Incidentally, “Rogers” for “Rodgers”, is not the only slip of its kind: we also have the artist Edward Hooper, even in the index; arrangements by Herb Pomery, for Pomeroy; and difficult topics “poured over” more than once.</p><p>For a time, Brubeck’s music became a family business, with his sons rounding out the Quartet, and edging Dad towards rock fusion and electro-funk; and then there was a late quartet of established pros, with the energetic Bobby Militello on sax – essentially the group Clark shared the band bus with. My own last view of Brubeck at the piano was an odd one, the eightieth birthday concert of George Shearing at Carnegie Hall, where George and Dave duetted on Brubeck’s ballad “In Your Own Sweet Way”. It was affecting to see the comradeship of two veterans who had often been brutally criticized for what they were not, rather than praised for what they were. I thought Brubeck looked quite frail at the time, but he had more than a decade’s more music in him. When he died late in 2012, seventy years had passed since, in his graduation year of 1942, he had privately recorded a clangorous, headlong piano-solo version of “I’ve Found a New Baby”, worthy in parts of Art Tatum. It was something he remained proud of all his life. “People who say I can’t swing, or I’m heavy-handed,” he told Clark, “they need to hear this.”</p>\",\"date\":\"2020-8-17\",\"link\":\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/strange-times/\",\"discrp\":\"Before Miles Davis and Ornette Coleman, Dave Brubeck was the name most likely to start an argument among jazz fans.\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","{\"content\":\"<p>For the next step, you'll be taken to a website to complete the donation and enter your billing information.

But the essayist and critic George Scialabba did not, ultimately, use it as a farewell to the world. “I was, fortunately, too exhausted and disorganized to plan a suicide, much less compose an elegant rebuke to an uncaring world,” he writes.</p><p>Instead Scialabba transformed his note into How To Be Depressed, a slim memoir-cum-medical-journal that recounts his four-decade experience with depression.</p><p>The physical or mental causes of depression still evade definitive analysis. But Scialabba argues that economic conditions can certainly exacerbate existing depression or trigger someone into a depressive episode. In one of its guises, depression makes people feel worthless, in both the cultural and economic senses. Unemployment can move someone from “the merely miserable” into actual, clinical depression.</p><p>The recent coronavirus pandemic that brought unemployment claims to record numbers has thrown this vulnerability into sharp relief. Worries over mental health have skyrocketed; the Washington Post reported that the pandemic has caused a “historic” rise in mental health issues. So, in this sense, depression is indeed an economic issue; as Scialabba wryly notes, one’s susceptibility to depression, like the skills and talents one may have at birth, are apportioned largely at random.</p><p>Suffering exists, and will exist. Money, however, and our ability to use it to ameliorate that suffering, is not random and can be directed where it is needed. Better mental health services, or a wider social safety net, might have ameliorative effects on people balanced on the edge. The suffering of many caused by depression, diagnosed or otherwise, “would also have been lessened by crumbs of that wealth”; transferred to the “already rich” over the last four decades. Scialabba’s own life is testament to that; although he remained generally consistently employed, he has never been financially secure, a concern that has only grown over his years of treatment.</p><p>How To Be Depressed opens with an essay called “Message from Room 101,” that room in Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four that contains your deepest fear, the fear you would wish upon another to avoid yourself. But for those with depression, you cannot avoid it. Depression will come, as a weight, or as a feeling of life draining away, or as a writhing sort of pain, and you are back in Room 101. Scialabba resorts to classic literary depictions of depression to explain how it feels; his models are Kay Jamison, Kate Millett, William Styron, and William James.</p><p>All are vivid portrait artists. Jamison felt her life was “bloodless, pulseless, and yet present enough to allow a suffocating horror and pain. All bearings are lost; all things are dark and drained of feeling.” Styron called it a “fiercely over-heated room. And because no breeze stirs this cauldron, because there is no escape from this smothering confinement, it is entirely natural that the victim begins to think ceaselessly of oblivion.” Not just think it, in some cases; as Scialabba suggests, sometimes to actively wish for oblivion.</p><p>Styron’s metaphor works in two ways. A victim feels trapped within the body, as in a closed room; you feel separated from your physical self that in certain extreme cases can result in a kind of disassociation. But at the same time, you also feel closed off from everyone else as well. For Scialabba, James’s description is most fitting; depression is a “positive and active anguish, a form of psychical neuralgia.” It is also, as someone once said about the experience of starting a family, both totally individual and completely cliché. The pain is thoroughly unique, and you cannot believe that anyone else has experienced it, or that it will ever end, although you know both to be true.</p><p>But the literary analysis soon ends; Scialabba does not mean to simply add yet another personal account. During a depressive episode, the pain takes over completely and makes it difficult to process what is happening, much less describe it. But when the episode ends, the brain compensates and tries to take control by describing that experience and and normalizing it. Deception, of oneself and others, is perhaps inevitable.</p><p>Instead, Scialabba lets diagnosis take center stage. The book’s longest section, “Documentia,” and its most distinctive feature, is not in Scialabba’s own voice. The section contains more than four decades’ worth of therapist and medical reflections, the actual notes written from 1969 to 2016.</p><p>Scialabba is initially referred to a therapist in 1969 as a “courtesy” shortly after his graduation from Harvard. Over the decades, we see him cycle through a series of them, the notes serving, as he puts it, as a “bill of lading” for this merchandise of a human psyche they are trying to understand and repair. By 2005, he is having yet another episode, this one perhaps one of the worst, and is prescribed electroconvulsive treatment. It seems to work, though no one knows why. Then it is back to antidepressants in 2007; over the years, he is prescribed more than a dozen different drugs. In 2016, glaucoma and the loss of sight in one eye trigger another relapse; the doctor reports that Scialabba “feels his life is over.” Finally, Scialabba retires after working for 35 years: one life in a hundred pages.</p><p>The onset of depression seems to have been caused by his decision to leave Opus Dei, a Catholic religious group, and eventually to leave the Church and religious faith altogether. The first entry records that Scialabba “comes with very intense questions regarding Catholicism,” and the significance of this break to his mental health comes up again and again through the 1970s and 1980s. A doctor recounts that Scialabba “feels he has been paralyzed emotionally and intellectually ever since he broke with his Catholic faith and left Opus Dei to study intellectual history.” By 1991, the notes record that Scialabba “all of this began” after he left Opus Dei and the anxiety that caused has never quite gone away.”What Scialabba himself thinks of the connection between his loss of faith and his depression comes through only indirectly; he attributes the psychological earthquake his loss of faith caused to a combination of factors, including genetics, what he calls a lack of emotional or mental shock absorbers supple enough to handle trauma or catastrophic life events.</p><p>In a “Conversation About Depression” included here, Scialabba acknowledges his religious break was important, but it was followed by another shock. Opus Dei enabled him to engage intellectually, as a way out of his relatively uneducated family background. But he found too high a demand was placed on “orthodoxy and lack of investigation,” as that 1969 report has it. Scialabba thought perhaps becoming a priest would be a “way of connecting with a cosmopolitan organization.”</p><p>When he lost his faith, however, he was still comforted. Having gone to college, unlike his parents, he saw intellectual stimulation could be found outside religion. “I thought […] I would be placing myself in the ranks of a great army of liberation going all the way back to the first modern philosophers,” going back to the Enlightenment. But there was a catch: once the scaffolding fell away the liberation lasted only so long, and the withdrawal he felt “was one of agitation and anxiety.” The consolations of D. H. Lawrence’s paganism, the tradition with which Scialabba says he now most closely identifies, were insufficient recompense.</p><p>A person suffering from depression does not choose “how” to be depressed. The feeling simply comes in like a tide, washing your vision with a filter that renders everything you see not quite clear — Styron’s locked room again. But once you have lived with depression, one indeed has to choose “how” to live it. Scialabba chose a particular path, selecting relatively routine jobs and maintaining his literary life. Regular teaching or academic scholarship was, it seems, too much.</p><p>The book ends with Scialabba’s own advice for depressives. In contrast to the political and economic themes set forth in the earlier sections and the clinical diagnoses of the documentia, this last chapter is personal, with deeply compassionate advice both to the suffering and those who live with and care for them. Friends, food, water, rest, exercise, caregivers, and reading are ways to take control, and if all else seems lost, remember what he calls a truth “close to a scientific certainty; depressions virtually always end.”</p><p>By submitting this form, you are granting: Los Angeles Review of Books, 6671 Sunset Blvd., Ste. 1521, Los Angeles, California, 90028, United States, http://lareviewofbooks.org permission to email you.</p>\",\"date\":\"2020-8-15\",\"link\":\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-enigma-of-gloom-on-george-scialabbas-how-to-be-depressed/\",\"discrp\":\"George Scialabba's book began as a suicide note. “I was, fortunately, too exhausted and disorganized to plan a suicide, much less compose an elegant rebuke to an uncaring world”.\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","{\"content\":\"<p>Three years after #MeToo allegations sank his Laurene Powell Jobs–funded magazine, Leon Wieseltier wants back in</p><p>At 4:59 p.m. on Tuesday, October 24, 2017, Politico revealed that allegations of workplace harassment made against the journalist and intellectual Leon Wieseltier had resulted in both the cancellation of Idea, Wieseltier’s new magazine, which had been scheduled to launch the following week, and of Wieseltier himself.</p><p>According to the story, Laurene Powell Jobs’s Emerson Collective, which funded Idea, had severed ties with him.

Mead was bound for the west coast and then American Samoa, her first fieldwork expedition as a junior anthropologist. Benedict was stopping in New Mexico to study myth and ritual in the Zuni Pueblo. The journey took them through Ohio to Illinois, across the prairie, then south toward the deserts. It was the longest the two of them had ever spent together, certainly the longest without their husbands in tow.</p><p>They had become acquainted more than two years earlier, Mead as an undergraduate at Barnard College, Benedict as her teaching assistant. It had taken time for Mead to stop referring to “Mrs. Benedict,” but over the years, something had changed. “She rests me like a padded chair and a fireplace,” Benedict jotted in her diary. Now, on the train west, Mead would remember weeping in Benedict’s arms, parsing her troubled marriage and other romantic entanglements. Benedict would later lie awake thinking of the nights they spent on the train—making love, kissing Mead’s fingers, trailing her lips across the palm of her hand. “Tofa, my sweetheart,” Mead wrote in a letter once she got to Samoa, using the local term for goodbye. “In my dreams I bury my face in your hair.” She had long signed her notes to Benedict with “love,” as one might to an older sister. But now she could say it all plainly, outright. “And always I love you.”</p><p>For the rest of their lives together, they would be each other’s polestar, sharing insights and triumphs, frustrations from the field, gossip from the Columbia anthropology department, confidences about their marriages to men and their romances with other women, and critiques of whatever manuscript the other one happened to be working on at the time. “For the first time in my life, I expect defeat,” Mead told Benedict not long after they parted near Gallup, New Mexico. But within a few years, she was on her way to becoming one of the most celebrated and controversial public scientists of the century. The book she completed after that trip, Coming of Age in Samoa, published in 1928, would be hailed as a classic in the literature on sexuality and adolescence. Benedict’s star was slower to rise but no less brilliant. Her Patterns of Culture, published in 1934, and The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, an empathetic analysis of Japanese society published right after World War II, remain signposts in the history of the social sciences.</p><p>For Mead and Benedict, social theory was a tool for making sense of the world, but it could also be a lever against your own predicaments. To do anthropology well, you had to alienate yourself from everything familiar, to take a slow train toward another way of seeing reality. The payoff was a liberating and original way of viewing your own society, denuded of its specialness and its constraints. And if you had always felt somehow out of kilter in your own culture—an “abnormal” or a “deviant,” an “invert” or a “mixed type,” as Benedict would later put it in her writings—you might come to understand why your own life had been such a struggle.</p><p>“I believe every person of ordinary sex endowment has a capacity for diffuse ‘homosexual’ sex expression,” Mead wrote to Benedict in 1933, this time from a new field site in New Guinea. “To call men who prefer [a] different expression ‘feminine’ or women ... ‘masculine,’ or both ‘mixed types’ is a lot of obfuscation.” Everything was to some degree potentiality, until it got channeled in a specific direction by circumstance and the rule-scape into which one was born. Mead had seen all of this at work among people she met in the field—the “deviants” who lived perfectly satisfactory lives when a given society made room for them—and she could see it in herself, in the hidden yearnings and desires she shared with Benedict. She was now pursuing a new line of thought that would be “the climax of the work I’ve done this last year,” she told Benedict, “a combination of anthropology and reviewed biography.”</p><p>What if a key to understanding human difference lay in how societies standardized an individual’s specific personality? All this was easiest to see, Mead said, when it came to women and men. In her fieldwork in New Guinea and elsewhere, she had recorded men who dressed as women, women who took on the social role of men, and everything in between. But describing things that way felt like a conceptual straitjacket. She found herself forced to explain an entirely different social world by relying only on the binary categories of female and male that she knew from her own society.</p><p>How could Mead make sense of a way of being and loving that, in her own society, was cloaked in angst and secrecy?</p><p>The world Mead knew best—the United States in the interwar years—had selected a thing it called sex to be the container in which an individual’s essential self resided. Biological women and men were said to have basic qualities that everyone in the culture could describe fluently. Boldness, aggressiveness, and dominance got catalogued as male. Gentleness, motherliness, and creativity got catalogued as female. But no one in Mead’s society associated being big-eared or green-eyed with inherent traits of character. Claiming that people with protruding ears were naturally weak-willed, for example, would seem plain silly. Her culture had evolved in such a way that being female or male was a basic, binary, and deeply meaningful way of classifying reality. Having prominent ears or green eyes wasn’t.</p><p>By 1935 she had wrapped these thoughts into a new book she called Sex and Temperament. It represented Mead’s most serious attempt to bring fieldwork together with grand social theory, and then to aim all of it at the core problem that ran through her long relationship with Benedict: how to make sense of a way of being and loving that, in her own society, was cloaked in angst and secrecy.</p><p>Our society makes a heavy investment in sex differences, Mead wrote. It expects women and men to behave very differently, from birth forward, simply on the basis of their biology. It “plays out the whole drama of courtship, marriage, and parenthood in terms of types of behavior believed to be innate and therefore appropriate for one sex or for the other.” We build our slang, our jokes, our medicine, even our obscenity around the belief that sex and social behavior go together. A person who doesn’t fit their designated type—someone who gets labeled an effete man or a manly woman—seems at odds with the natural order of things. Mead knew what that felt like. “You keep [your mind] too near your devices for loving,” one male colleague told her, drawing the link explicitly. “Loathsome bitch,” said another.</p><p>\\nMy wife Ingrid and I had been in Aburi, Ghana for just over a week when our host, Kwame Obeng, informed me that I’d be joining the royal drummers for a performance at the chief’s palace the following afternoon, in...READ MORE\\n</p><p>All societies seemed to assign specific social roles to these biological types. But not all human cultures believed that these social roles were derived from biology, Mead observed, or that differences between women and men were categorical and obvious. For one thing, you needed a modern science of biology to do that—something that a traditional society in Samoa or New Guinea didn’t really have. Even then, if you could demonstrate that, on average, people with penises were disposed to behave one way and those without to behave another, you were still left with two problems. First, the degree of difference within each category was likely to be greater than between the categories. No great gulf of behavior separated all men from all women. Second, there was no easy way of distinguishing the behaviors that were a product of social factors from those that were supposedly innate. Penises couldn’t explain everything.</p><p>The only thing that was universal, Mead said, was the independent existence of sexual roles and of differences in individual personalities, or what she called temperament. Where societies differed was in how they drew lines between these two things—in other words, which specific temperaments a society assigned to femaleness and maleness. You couldn’t begin to talk about deep differences between the sexes until you also understood the alleged qualities a society attributed to each sex. Indeed, you’d also want to know whether a society bothered much with assigning unique, categorical qualities to them at all. From her research in New Guinea, she had at her fingertips three very different societies that, on her account, just didn’t—three peoples living in the Sepik River region that she knew as the Arapesh, the Mundugumor, and the Tchambuli.</p><p>All three communities gave discrete tasks to women and men. On her account, the Mundugumor thought fishing was an occupation appropriate mainly to women, while the Arapesh considered painting in color to be the exclusive purview of men. They had their own local theories about why this was a commonsensical arrangement, but no one seemed to believe that these roles had anything to do with inherent personality. Women were better at carrying heavy loads because their heads were harder and stronger, the Arapesh would say, not because women were naturally suited to servile tasks. The Mundugumor valued acquisitiveness and suspicion, according to Mead, but they believed these traits to be equally dispersed among women and men. The Tchambuli tended to put men in the role of artists who spent their days carving wooden masks and dancing, while the women fished and prepared food. But they, too, made no distinction between women and men as to the distribution of their innate potentialities.</p><p>Western societies, Mead concluded, had learned over time to associate specific temperaments with the social roles into which they placed the biological sexes. Since women were by and large given the role of nurturing mother, it was convenient to believe that they were by nature careful, attentive, and focused on the wellbeing of children. Since men were given the roles of politician and war-maker, it was equally convenient to believe that biology predisposed them to discernment and bravery. But to see this alignment of sex and temperament as the only possible way of organizing society was to mistake effect for cause. Sex roles, Mead argued, came first, the product of a long and complex process of circumstance, cultural borrowing, change, and chance. Only later came the “standardization of sex-temperament,” as she called it, to fit these preexisting roles.</p><p>The real question to ask of her own society, she said, was how far people might be willing to open themselves to the idea that human potential did not come prepackaged according to biological sex. Following the social science usage of the time, Mead never employed the term gender in anything other than a linguistic sense, such as nouns that might be classed as feminine, masculine, or neuter. But in Sex and Temperament, she wanted to draw a bright distinction between sex-as-biology—this brand of genitalia or that array of secondary sexual characteristics—and sex-as-social-category, or what would later come to be called gender. Sex could be thought of as a class of biological facts, at least for all but a small portion of human beings. Gender, on the other hand, was the product of a specific time and place—the discrete social positions that a given society assigned to women and men, or alternatively the menu of roles, behaviors, attractions, and potentialities that it made available to people, with little reference to biological sex at all.</p><p>All of this also gave Mead a way of understanding her own fate, as well as Benedict’s. Cultures are cunning tailors. They cut garments from convenience and then work hard to refashion individuals to fit them. Real liberation wasn’t necessarily about making women more manly or allowing men to be effeminate. It was about unleashing human beings’ potential from the roles that society had fashioned, seeing each person as a parcel of possibilities that might get expressed in many creative ways. Cultural change came about when enough people began to see that the old clothes simply didn’t fit.</p><p>Mead felt that her own society was obsessed with seeing people as “types” of some deeper, innate reality: black or white, female or male, normal or deviant, intelligent or feebleminded. But there were alternatives. “A civilization might take its cues not from such categories as sex, race or hereditary position in a family line,” Mead concluded in Sex and Temperament, “but instead of specializing personality along such simple lines recognize, train, and make a place for many and divergent temperamental endowments.” To do otherwise wasn’t at base a matter of injustice or oppression, although it produced plenty of both. It was just a terrible waste, a vast squandering of talent and energy, all bottled up inside people who were forced to live their lives as tragically less-than. She was making a point that campaigners for women’s rights, disabled access, and marriage equality would eventually take as fundamental: that nothing enhances social potential more than removing the barriers to full participation—a glass ceiling, a staircase, a law that delegitimizes the person you love.</p><p>In the years after Sex and Temperament was published, Mead would marry for a third time. Benedict’s husband would die of a heart attack—which also allowed her, as a widow, to move toward a tenured professorship at Columbia, something denied to married women at the time. Benedict herself succumbed to heart trouble several years later, in 1948. Condolences were sent to Mead as if she were the next of kin. In most ways that mattered, she was. “The discovery of anthropology … proved to be her salvation. That is where you came into the picture, Margaret,” wrote Benedict’s younger sister in a letter. “One of the deepest satisfactions of her life has been the privilege of stirring up your intellect, and then watching you carry the torch into fields where she could never go.”</p><p>Mead lived for another 30 years. She worked from attic rooms in the American Museum of Natural History in New York, her main employer, in a nest of field notebooks and tagged artifacts, handwritten letters and typed mimeographs, thousands upon thousands of pages and objects. On weekdays she could be seen purposefully striding the hallways with a notched walking stick, the better to support a weak ankle she had nursed since graduate school, and wearing a distinctive felt cape, an affectation of middle age. Her early books on Samoa and New Guinea each went through as many as 17 editions and 20 foreign translations. Her typical year’s output might include a scholarly book, articles in learned journals, encyclopedia entries, and short pieces in Good Housekeeping and Redbook that spun anthropological findings into practical advice. Mead’s address book was a who’s who of the era’s greatest sociologists, philosophers, psychologists, and political leaders. She reveled in the new findings that were upending old ways of thinking. Alfred Kinsey catalogued the enormous variety of sexual practices unspooling inside suburban bedrooms. William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson conducted laboratory studies of human erotic response that characterized same-sex attraction not as an abnormality but as a form of sexuality to be understood. Their work would inform the striking, by the late 1980s, of homosexuality from psychologists’ lists of diagnosable illnesses.</p><p>For Mead’s 75th birthday in December 1976, The New York Times featured a full-page announcement in her honor. Less than two years later, in the spring of 1978, she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She died that November. In the decades that followed, there would be a U.S. postage stamp with her portrait and a Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded posthumously for her struggle to show, as the White House citation read, “that varying cultural patterns express an underlying human unity.” Her stick and cape were eventually placed on permanent display near the American Museum of Natural History’s exhibit on the cultures of the Pacific. When visitors go there today, they enter under a sign welcoming them to Margaret Mead Hall.</p><p>In 1987 the philosopher Allan Bloom published his treatise on the parlous state of American society and the country’s misguided universities. The Closing of the American Mind became a bestseller and a classic among cultural conservatives. “Almost every student entering the university believes, or says he believes, that truth is relative,” Bloom wrote in the book’s first sentence. He went on to name the people who had led young people into this amoral thicket. “Sexual adventurers like Margaret Mead and others who found America too narrow told us that not only must we know other cultures and learn to respect them, but we could also profit from them,” he wrote with sarcasm. “We could follow their lead and loosen up, liberating ourselves from the opinion that our taboos are anything other than social constraints. We could go to the bazaar of cultures and find reinforcement for inclinations that are repressed by puritanical guilt feelings.”</p><p>Although he was surveying the entirety of Western thought, Bloom could think of very few women worth mentioning. Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict were among them—and the source of the problem, as Bloom saw it. There had been a fundamental transformation in the intellectual outlook of the West, he believed. It involved a turning away from tradition and an embrace of the wrongheaded idea that there was nothing world-shatteringly special about American democracy or its traditional ways of dealing with gender, sex, and love. The relativity of sexuality, morality, history, and social reality had become the new orthodoxy, scotching the ability of young people to search dispassionately for what constituted an authentic, meaningful life.</p><p>Go awkwardly, bravely to places where we are sure to meet someone unlike us—a tropical island, a desert pueblo, or across town.</p><p>Had they been around, Mead and Benedict would have been surprised by the news that they had triumphed. They had lived their lives as struggles. Every year seemed to produce another front in the battle against the purveyors of old certainties, a new frontier on which to show that difference was nothing to be afraid of. Every society must come to grips with the same basic problems, they insisted: how to organize itself, how to raise a child, how to treat the aged, how to reproduce properly, how to love well. Over time humans have developed many answers to these questions. The versions most familiar to some Americans—a spring wedding in white, summer camp for a rambunctious adolescent, a declining parent placed in the care of strangers—don’t necessarily produce happiness, efficiency, or fulfillment. They are just one way of doing things, the product of this history, this philosophizing, and this set of conditions.</p><p>Our molecules, genes, and brains nudge us in particular directions. Sometimes, they shove us, shaping the possibilities of existence and our individual pathways through life. But what we mean by things like appropriate gender roles, proper sexual behavior, or an abnormal mind is a creation of human beings in repeated interaction with one another—that is, of a society—not of our innards. Distinguishing right from wrong is a matter of philosophy, yet it rests on a matter of fact: our prior conception of what is obvious or given, versus what is ludicrous or absurd. The expansion of our sense of morality depends on first enlarging the realm of the thinkable.</p><p>And that in turn often requires, as it did for Mead and Benedict, to go awkwardly, bravely to places where we are sure to meet someone unlike us—a tropical island, a desert pueblo, or across town. All societies are just snippets of “the great arc of potential human purposes and motivations,” Benedict once wrote. The world at large is a laboratory of possible lives. To live intelligently and act justly come down to the same thing, expressed in a scientific finding that these two women spun out of their fieldwork adventures, their second-class status as female academics, their unnamable love: that there is no such thing as a defective human being.</p><p>Charles King is the author of Gods of the Upper Air.

As Greene was one of the most respected writers of his day, this was no small gesture, but the author was also a committed bibliophile. The book dealer and biographer John Baxter’s memoir A Pound of Paper contains treasurable glimpses of Greene deliberately signing obscure copies of his works in far-off locations, in the certain knowledge that these items would become hugely sought-after rarities, and he remains one of the few serious literary figures who also understood the glamour and romance of the bookselling trade. In his introduction, he openly acknowledged this, writing ‘Secondhand booksellers are the most friendly and most eccentric of all the characters I have known. If I had not been a writer, theirs would have been the profession I would most happily have chosen.’</p><p>If Greene was alive today, he would look at his beloved second-hand and antiquarian bookshops with an air of sorrow, leavened with a touch of bewilderment. The recent news that one of Charing Cross’s most famous booksellers, Francis Edwards, was to close after 150 years, maintaining only a presence in Hay-on-Wye, was greeted without the anguish that it might have been otherwise. After all, covid closures are ten a penny these days, and in the era of Amazon and Abebooks, maintaining an expensive shop in central London without regular footfall might seem a folly. Yet the story of Francis Edwards, which had been allied to another shop, Quinto, since 2008, comes to epitomise the decline not only of a certain sort of retail, but sounds the death knell of an entire industry, which, despite or perhaps because of its unworldly and vaguely anachronistic nature, has remained a constant part of many people’s lives and affections for decades.</p><p>Francis Edwards first opened a second-hand bookshop on Marylebone High Street in 1855. It was a success, and so in 1912 Edwards’ descendants moved to a new premises at 83 Marylebone High Street, which David Low (in the memoir to which Greene contributed an introduction) described as ‘the most pleasantly designed bookshop anywhere’. It was custom-made to be as beautiful and charming a shop as could be imagined, and it continues that tradition today as the flagship of Daunt Books, scene to many a bibulous book launch of the literati. Yet, as Charing Cross (and its offshoot Cecil Court) became the Mecca for booksellers and purchasers alike, it was inevitable that a relocation had to take place, and, once Francis Edwards merged with Quinto, they established themselves amongst the much-patronised bookshops of central London, even as the seeds of the destruction of the entire industry had been sown fifty miles away.</p><p>But it, and the other Oxfam bookshops in Britain, sounded the death knell for other, ‘normal’ bookshops</p><p>The Oxfam bookshop on St Giles in Oxford is, for my money, the most likeable and successful of all the many Oxfam bookshops in the country. It is unique in that its stock is not just interesting and desirable, but replenished on a virtually daily basis; it is extremely rare that I walk past its front window and don’t see at least five books that I want to buy immediately. It is especially strong in history, literature and illustrated books, often selling rare and valuable items at surprisingly reasonable prices, even if the big-ticket books, lurking provocatively in a glass case, can sell for many hundreds of pounds. It was founded in 1987 as Oxfam’s first dedicated bookshop, and was opened by the author and barrister John Mortimer; he later returned two decades subsequently to celebrate the shop’s 21st birthday. It is a wonderful place, and I cannot even begin to calculate how much money I have spent there, as a student in the city, a visitor and now a resident. But it, and the other Oxfam bookshops in Britain, sounded the death knell for other, ‘normal’ bookshops.</p><p>The reasons why are simple. Every book that the Oxfam bookshop stocks has been donated, meaning firstly that there are no acquisition costs to be borne, and secondly, as the majority of the staff are volunteers, the only costs of employment are that of a manager, who can often be responsible for several different shops. Otherwise, given the charity’s abilities to claim tax relief from the government for rent and bills, it is making a considerably greater amount of profit than any competing bookshop could ever hope to do. Thus, the rest of the bookselling trade, faced with this cuckoo in the nest and the rise of internet availability, faced a simple choice: evolve, or perish. It is a shame that so many shops decided, as if it was pre-ordained, that they would shut their doors and that would be the end of that, thank you very much.</p><p>The example of Oxford is typical. For decades, it had one of the widest selections of second-hand and antiquarian bookshops in the country. There was the famous Thornton’s, which had opened on the city’s greatest street, Broad Street, in 1835, and took pleasure in having sold books to everyone from Oscar Wilde and Philip Larkin to David Cameron and Margaret Thatcher. CS Lewis and JRR Tolkien were regular customers, and much of Iris Murdoch’s personal library was eventually sold through it after her death. It was owned and staffed by the Thornton family, and the last of them, ‘Young Jack’, could offer stories about WB Yeats praising it as ‘a true bookshop’ (with a dig at nearby Blackwells being more interested in ‘pennies than words’).</p><p>Yet by the time that I visited it as a student two decades ago, it was clearly on its last legs. Its stock was overpriced and tired; there were countless examples of dull, battered mid-20th century history and literature for sale, but unless one had a desperate urge to own the collected criticism of Lord David Cecil or AC Bradley, it offered remarkably little for the bibliophile. It eventually closed its doors at the beginning of 2003, and only the closing down sale, in which its stock was sold at heavy discounts, saw customers return in any numbers. It is now a hotel and café, and is surrounded by gift shops selling Harry Potter merchandise.</p><p>Such, alas, is the case for much of the contemporary bookshop trade. It is hugely expensive to rent a decent-sized premises in any of the major tourist destinations in this country, with the result that many of the independently owned second-hand bookshops have closed over the past couple of decades, with their proprietors preferring to deal online, or to pursue another occupation altogether. Places such as Bath, Oxford, Cambridge and Stratford-upon-Avon, which once used to offer rich pickings in their hugely diverting bookshops, have now seen most of them disappear entirely, driven away by high rents, a lack of demand and a sense that, in 2020, the second-hand bookshop is somehow inessential. The circle of bibliophile life has meant that many carefully built-up collections and libraries, harvested from now defunct bookshops, are now either given in their entirety to the local Oxfam, or sold off at auction after the richest pickings have been carefully harvested by one of the remaining successful dealers still going.</p><p>The circle of bibliophile life has meant that many carefully built-up collections and libraries, harvested from now defunct bookshops, are now either given in their entirety to the local Oxfam or sold off at auction</p><p>Still, a glamour remains, even as the trade seems endangered.  One of publishing’s more surprising success stories over the past few years was the bestselling book The Diary of a Bookseller by Shaun Bythell. It is an account of Bythell’s time as proprietor of the largest bookshop (simply named ‘The Bookshop’) in the ‘National Book Town’ of Wigtown in Scotland, in which he presents himself as a sane (if somewhat grumpy) man beset by eccentrics and the absurd, and those are just his staff. It is hugely entertaining as an account of the everyday goings-on inside a modern-day bookshop, but, as Bythell punctiliously notes, there are always the economic realities of running a shop like his to be borne in mind. Bad weather, something of a perennial issue in Wigtown, can often lead to next to no trade, and it is the dreaded internet that can often drive sales, rather than any amount of casual footfall.</p><p>It is possible to read Bythell’s book and be overwhelmed, even terrified, by the amount of effort that running a second-hand bookshop seems to involve. He is forever travelling vast distances to spend considerable amounts of money on buying new stock, only to return to his shop to find that one of his assistants has committed some new outrage and sold a priceless item for next to nothing in a moment of whimsy. Yet those of a romantic disposition might also read The Diary of a Bookseller and its sequel Confessions of a Bookseller and find the whole idea of running a second-hand bookshop both fun and rather inspiring. Wigtown also hosts the country’s only Airbnb bookshop, The Open Book, which enables paying guests the opportunity to run the shop as they wish for a week or two. Although this might sound like hard work, it has been hugely popular with those who fancy their hands at bookselling, and the lengthy waiting list (paused for the time being, of course) is testament to how endlessly appealing the idea of having one’s own shop – even for a couple of weeks – remains.</p><p>I have written before about my own long history of book collecting, and occasional dealing. After I finish writing this piece, I shall be heading off to the excellent and hugely knowledgeable rare book department in Blackwells with a couple of recent acquisitions, and see if they might be interested in buying them. I hope so; my own shelves are long since full and my wife tends to look askance at me whenever I walk into a second-hand bookshop, because she knows that the chances of my leaving empty-handed are next to zero.

By the early 1900s, one out of every seven deaths in the United States and Europe was caused by tuberculosis, according to figures compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the very randomness of its reach made it especially onerous. Commonly known for centuries as consumption, the highly infectious disease played no favorites when choosing its victims, striking across all segments of society, rich and poor, young and old, men and women of all races and ethnic groups—an ever-present existential threat, in today’s parlance, if ever there was one.</p><p>For most of the 1800s, consumption was thought to be a hereditary, constitutional sickness of nonspecific origin, and not communicable. It wasn’t until 1882 that the German scientist Robert Koch identified the tuberculosis bacillus, helping convince medical and public health officials that it was indeed contagious; he would win the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1905 in recognition of his efforts. An immediate consequence was the increased observance of precautionary measures known more immediately to millions of people around the world in recent months as “social distancing.” To the constant fear of that scourge were added visitations of cholera, smallpox, typhus, and yellow fever, each also accounting for thousands of deaths. During the Civil War, camp fever, a term used for a variety of contagious illnesses endemic to the close-quartered military encampments of the period, most severely typhoid fever, took the lives of more soldiers, along with diarrhea and dysentery, than injuries inflicted in combat. It was only toward the end of the nineteenth century that vaccines came into widespread use, with antibiotic drugs following in the twentieth.</p><p>One of the more compelling backstories I encountered while researching my recently published book, Cross of Snow: A Life of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, was how the principals of my study responded to uncertainties particular to the times, most tellingly life-and-death situations they frequently faced, over which they had no control. “Yesterday I was at Mount Auburn, and saw my own grave dug; that is, my own tomb,” Longfellow wrote matter-of-factly to George Washington Greene, one of his closest friends, on May 21, 1837, 45 years before he finally would occupy the freshly dug plot in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “I assure you, I looked quietly down into it without one feeling of dread. It is a beautiful spot, this Mount Auburn. Were you ever there?”</p><p>The thirty-year-old poet had recently returned to the United States from an extended trip abroad to assume duties as the newly installed Smith Professor of Modern Languages at Harvard College. Among tasks that awaited his attention was the burial of Mary Storer Potter Longfellow, his first wife, who had died 18 months earlier in Rotterdam at the age of twenty-three, the victim of what modern physicians surmise to have been an “infected incomplete miscarriage,” a complication that would be routinely diagnosed and treated today. Although emotionally shattered by the loss of her, Longfellow had chosen to remain in Europe and continue learning the languages he would be required to teach at Harvard: Swedish, Danish, Finnish, Dutch, Old Icelandic, and German, to go along with the French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese he had mastered a decade earlier in preparation for a similar position at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. After arranging for the shipment of Mary’s remains, he resumed the task at hand.</p><p>Many young mothers, such as Longfellow’s first wife, succumbed to complications and infections relating to child birth.

The independently wealthy scion of a prominent Beacon Hill family, Ticknor had decided to step back from teaching at the age of forty-three, following the death of a five-year-old son, the cause a “very obscure” heart infection later determined to have been pericarditis. In the years ahead, Ticknor would channel his energies into a variety of worthy pursuits, including the writing of History of Spanish Literature, a mammoth work in three volumes considered definitive from the time it first appeared in print in 1849, and leading the effort to establish in 1852 the Boston Public Library, the first major free municipal library in the United States. “While my little boy lived, I looked only to the future, and considered him only as a bright hope, that was growing brighter every day,” he had written to a close friend in Maine, Charles Daveis, explaining his reasons for retiring. “But now that he is gone I look at the past and present, and, yielding all the future, in a spirit of resignation, to God, I feel the immediate loss, the pressing want of something that was so dear to me, and that was associated, without my knowing it, to everything around and within me.”</p><p>In a follow-up letter to Daveis, Ticknor further clarified his feelings in a way that echoes other responses to loss and grieving we see in the letters and journals of the period. “Sorrow still dwells among us, and must for a season,” he began in tones that evoke a kind of benediction. “The melancholy which is impressed on the heart by severe suffering, as you well know from experience, seems to come up afresh long afterwards, from depths you knew not of at the time, just as the passing bell continues to give up its deep and heavy tones long after it has ceased to be struck. But this, too, will pass away, under the healing influence of time and those higher principles of our nature which, with the help of religion, are able to control all the rest.”</p><p>Writing to Longfellow immediately upon hearing the “dreadful news” of Mary’s death, Ticknor firmly counseled his young colleague to “pray give yourself to constant and interesting intellectual labor,” a form of inner healing, he stressed, “that will go further than any other remedy, at least such is my experience.” Heeding Ticknor’s advice, Longfellow hunkered down in Heidelberg for the winter and “buried himself in books, in old, dusty books,” all the while admitting to his father in Maine that his “bereavement” was “deep and unutterable,” and that “it required a great deal of effort to discipline my thoughts to regular study.” For six months he soldiered on, but “the monotonous every day life” had him declaring in his journal finally that “I cannot study: and therefore think I better go home.” In the very next sentence, he had another idea: “Perhaps the air of the Fatherland will do me good.” With that, he set out on a summer tour of the Rhineland that took him eventually into Switzerland, and the serendipitous meeting at an Interlaken inn with Frances Elizabeth Appleton, an eighteen-year-old Boston socialite everyone called Fanny, then traveling through Europe with her family on a trip that had also been undertaken as a form of therapy for shared grief.</p><p>—Gift of I. N. Phelps Stokes, Edward S. Hawes, Alice Mary Hawes, and Marion Augusta Hawes, 1937, 10.8 X 8.3 cm / Metropolitan Museum of Art</p><p>Three weeks before the Appletons set sail for France in November 1835, Fanny’s twenty-year-old brother, Charles Sedgwick Appleton, had died of consumption, a devastating blow to his three siblings and their father, each of whom was confronted with the agony of what had suddenly become a double loss. Two and a half years earlier, the family matriarch, Maria Theresa Gold Appleton, died of the same sickness at the age of forty-six. Nathan Appleton was serving out a term as a member of Congress in Washington, D.C., as his wife lay dying in Boston at the time, and had never forgiven himself for failing to be at her bedside, his frantic efforts to get home by teams of post-horses hired along the route proving futile by a matter of hours. Maria Theresa had struggled mightily to retain consciousness, refusing any medications that might have put her to sleep, according to a journal kept by her daughters. “She kept her eyes anxiously fixed on the clock, to watch for the hour of [our] Father’s arrival, whom she expected to see, until the last moment,” they wrote. “This evening Father arrived, having heard that all was over, just before arriving in town. He was much agitated, and aggrieved, after traveling day and night.”</p><p>Nathan Appleton’s immediate response then was to take his children on a two-month tour of upstate New York, traveling by steamboat, railroad, and stagecoach to Niagara Falls and Canada, then meandering back home through Vermont and New Hampshire. For part of the journey they traveled on the Erie Canal, which had opened the western interior of the region to more expeditious travel just a few years earlier. The bonding experiment was such a success that when Charley Appleton died on October 26, 1835, Nathan Appleton decided an even grander adventure was in order, one normally reserved for affluent young men of the period, not women, but these were particularly anxious times, and he moved quickly. “We are now so desolate, with nothing to anticipate, and one loss making the few left more anxious for each other than ever, that Father has actually sent to N[ew] York to engage our passage to sail for Europe in a fortnight,” Fanny wrote Robert Apthorp, a close family friend from childhood, just three days after Charley died. “The slightest thought of it staggers and bewilders me so that I dare not yield to the excitement—and the indifference with which it now is viewed would have seemed last year incredible.”</p><p>Striking in every respect, Fanny Appleton was no typical young woman. At a time when higher education was the exclusive province of men, she had been impeccably taught by private tutors from early childhood, the pioneering educators Elizabeth Palmer Peabody and George Barrell Emerson, the art instructor Francis Graeter, and the expatriate writer and political theorist Francis Lieber, notable among her personal teachers and mentors. A voracious reader in several languages, Fanny was driven to embrace intellectual achievement on a variety of stimulating levels, as her rich body of correspondence, journals, and sketches persuasively demonstrate. For this two-year grand tour of the continent, she brought along a portable lap desk and an ample inventory of paper, art supplies, and writing instruments.</p><p>Joining the group were two of her cousins, one of them, the consumptive William “Willy” Sullivan Appleton, brought along by Fanny’s father with the faint hope of restoring his failing health, travel then considered a palliative to the disease. Their leisurely travels through France, Italy, Switzerland, and Germany were aboard two elegant coaches purchased in Paris and made with comfort and style in mind. As winter turned to spring and spring to summer, concern began to grow about Willy’s deteriorating condition and the pressing need to get him to higher, cooler ground. Departing Florence in June 1836, they headed for Bologna by way of the Apennines, providing Willy with some temporary relief. Word of a cholera epidemic in Venice persuaded them to head directly to Modena; from there they proceeded to Verona, and then on to Milan. Arriving in Switzerland toward the end of July, they took rooms in a “dashing new hotel” overlooking Lake Thun.</p><p>Fanny Appleton was an eighteen-year-old socialite from Boston when Longfellow met her on tour with her family in Europe. </p><p>—Courtesy of the National Park Service, Longfellow House / Washington’s Headquarters National Historic Site, catalog number, LONG 4807, 27 ¾” (70.5 cm) x 24 ½” (62.2 cm)</p><p>On the day Fanny learned that Longfellow sent up his card to her father with the hope of making the acquaintance of some fellow New Englanders he had learned were passing through, she was fresh from sketching a succession of breathtaking attractions in the countryside. “Hope the venerable gentleman won’t pop in on us,” she added, “tho’ I did like his Outre-Mer,” an acknowledgment, at least, that she had some sense of who he was, and that she had read his first book, a travelogue published a few years earlier. That he wasn’t “venerable” at all—he was twenty-nine years old at the time—became apparent several days later when the two finally did meet at an inn in Interlaken. Invited by Nathan Appleton to travel with them for a fortnight, Henry eagerly joined the entourage, riding in one of the carriages with Fanny, Mary, and Willy.</p><p>There is nothing in either of the journals Henry and Fanny kept at this time to indicate any kind of a spark that might ignite a lasting relationship. What both did record of their interactions, however, suggests an appreciation each had for the other’s mind, a key consideration since they both valued intellectual engagement above all other qualities. Not lost on Fanny either was the kindness and attention Henry paid to her cousin Willy, whose condition had taken an alarming turn for the worse.</p><p>Henry’s offer in Lucerne to stay with Willy while the others went out for a bit of sightseeing was greatly appreciated by Fanny. “He is a most gentle spirit,” Henry wrote in his journal, “resigned and uncomplaining, as one who has already commenced ‘his conversation in heaven,’” his reference to a famous homily by John Tillotson, the Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury from 1691 to 1694. To pass the time during the long rides, Henry and Fanny read aloud from uplifting sermons such as these for Willy’s benefit, and selections from William Hazlitt’s essay “The Fear of Death” (1822), notable for its opening line, “Perhaps the best cure for the fear of death is to reflect that life has a beginning as well as an end.” Willy found especially pleasing two “soul-thrilling” sermons of the Unitarian minister Orville Dewey, particularly that “touching one on the ‘Voices of the Dead.’”</p><p>Rowing on Lake Zurich with Henry, Mary, and her older brother Tom, who had joined the traveling party, did little to improve Fanny’s spirits. “How can I think of myself while he is growing so feeble daily, so patiently relinquishing the active habits he delights in and breaking our hearts with his self-forgetting thoughtfulness of all about him?” A physician brought in for an examination grimly reported that Willy was not likely to survive a voyage home; even a journey into Paris “would be too much” for him. “Oh God—but how will the poor child bear this terrible disappointment!” Fanny lamented. “He seems calm tho’ it is his death-knell, but he cannot get up stairs without aid.” An evening walk with Henry left Fanny contemplating the “dead, blank winter” to come, “but what is that to the pall the mind can weave for itself now.”</p><p>In Schaffhausen, Fanny and Henry walked into town to replenish their reading supply for the road ahead, and enjoyed a “long talk” in a park before heading back to the hotel. When they returned, Willy was organizing “all the little presents he has collected for his family” back home, Fanny marveled, and talked “with the utmost cheerfulness about the dispersal of them,” knowing “they can never be given by his own hand and will when received be sad legacies” of his passing. For Mary and Fanny, there were brooches acquired in Geneva to remember him by. Henry was greatly impressed by the young man’s courage, which he lauded that night in his journal. “It seems impossible that he should live many days. He is himself conscious of this, and is making his little gifts to friends with a calmness which is beautiful. How heavenly it is to die thus.”</p><p>On August 17, Henry received word that Clara Crowninshield, a dear friend of his late wife who had accompanied the couple on their European trip, was anxious to leave Heidelberg, where he had left her in the care of friends while he went off on his own, and return to the United States. Though Fanny had little to say one way or the other in her journal about whatever feelings she may have developed for Henry, she did concede two days later, with a paucity of words, that she did “miss Mr. L. considerably.” Some brisk fall air had “invigorated” Willy somewhat, but her general mood was otherwise gloomy. On August 24, a week after Henry’s departure, he died, peacefully, in his bed.</p><p>Henry received word of Willy’s death from Tom Appleton. “He desired me to remember him to all of his friends and for me to thank those who had been kind in service to him in his illness, among whom he felt that you were warmly included.” Grief-stricken at this loss, Fanny wrote nothing in her journal for several weeks, though she did open up a bit several months later in a letter to Robert Apthorp, sharing her impressions of the European trip thus far. Most of what she had experienced—the cultures, the art museums, the ballets, the theater, the Old World landmarks, the scenery—had been a revelation. “But over all this magic, anxiety, decay and death have thrown a tinge of sadness and there is a green corner by the blue Rhine where many aching hearts have bound the circle of their thoughts. I meant to write much to you about my sweet cousin William for the unsullied purity of his character and gentle sweetness of his disposition so ennobled his decay, shed such an atmosphere of heavenly hope and cheerful resignation around his last moments.”</p><p>Fanny admitted to some uneasy “presentiments” when she left home the previous year, but she had no idea that what she feared then would involve anyone other than herself. “I mention this only because it is the sole bit of superstition I ever indulged in. And I was again called to breathe comfort and hope to a gentle spirit hovering between two worlds,” the memories of her brother Charley and her adored mother, Maria Theresa, still fresh. In the end, she found William’s acceptance of his fate nothing less than inspirational. “From first to last he saw and felt his danger and met it with a Christian fortitude which was truly astonishing.”</p><p>Although not evident in his correspondence or diary of those first days he spent in her company, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was dazzled by Fanny’s mind, artistic sensibility, and razor-sharp wit—that, and her willingness to engage intellectually, her zest for life, her deep and abiding compassion for others. He described her in a letter to George Washington Greene several months later as nothing less than a “genius,” and confessed to being hopelessly in love.</p><p>Fanny (here, in an 1836 marble bust by Lorenzo Bartolini) and Henry admired each other’s minds, and she was indisputably his intellectual equal, but the poet’s work Hyperion, written expressly in an attempt to win her heart, missed its mark. </p><p>—Courtesy of the National Park Service, Longfellow House / Washington’s Headquarters National Historic Site / catalog number LONG 4426</p><p>The “courtship” of Fanny Appleton, if it can be called that, was a drama played out over the next seven years, and is a central component of Cross of Snow. Marked predominantly not by ups—but by anguished downs—Henry’s strategy to win her hand included the writing of Hyperion, an ill-advised “romance” that featured as a subtext the unsuccessful wooing of a charismatic young woman—Mary Ashburton—by a grief-stricken suitor, Paul Flemming, the true identities of the principals no mystery to many people on Beacon Hill or at Harvard in Cambridge. When they finally did resolve their issues and become husband and wife on July 13, 1843, it represented, in Henry’s words, a “Vita Nuova of happiness!” and ushered in eighteen prolific years of creative output that included the writing of the book-length narrative poems Evangeline, a Tale of Acadie (1847), The Song of Hiawatha (1855), and The Courtship of Miles Standish (1858),and numerous stand-alone classics such as “The Building of the Ship” (1849), “The Children’s Hour” (1860), and “Paul Revere’s Ride” (1861). Once together, moreover, the couple was inseparable. “It is part of our theory of life,” Henry would write to an admirer in Europe, “never to be separated.”</p><p>They lived in a magnificent Georgian mansion on Brattle Street in Cambridge overlooking the Charles River, a structure so imposing that George Washington chose it for his command headquarters and official residence for nine months during the Siege of Boston (1775–76); it is owned today by the National Park Service and known as Longfellow House–Washington’s Headquarters National Historic Site. The couple had two sons in short order, Charles and Ernest. The arrival of their third child on April 7, 1847, a girl named Fanny for her mother, made medical history by being the first birth in North America assisted by ether as an obstetric anesthetic.</p><p>The Longfellows posed for this family portrait in Portland, Maine, in 1847 with sons Charles and Ernest. In all likelihood, it was about this image that Henry later wrote, “Had a daguerreotype of Fanny and myself taken with the children, the two latter very charming, the two former not perfectly satisfactory.” </p><p>—Courtesy of the National Park Service, Longfellow House / Washington’s Headquarters National Historic Site, catalog number LONG 4437</p><p>Introduced just five months earlier by doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital, its use at that time was limited to general surgery and dentistry, the fear in childbirth being that ether could threaten the health of the mother or be unsafe for the baby. When Fanny learned that a woman in Scotland with a severely deformed pelvis had painlessly delivered a healthy child after being given the vapor, she lobbied Henry to investigate on her behalf. Finding no physicians willing to take the risk, and with time growing short, he turned to Dr. Nathan Cooley Keep, founding dean of the Harvard Dental School, who administered the miraculous compound to Fanny during labor while a midwife monitored the delivery. Fanny took great pride in the accomplishment, despite opposition from both branches of the family. “I am very sorry you all thought me so rash and naughty in trying the ether,” she wrote to one of Henry’s sisters, but was mindful nonetheless of what she had accomplished. “I feel proud to be the pioneer to less suffering for poor weak womankind. This is certainly the greatest blessing of this age and I am glad to have lived at the time of its coming and in the country which gives it to the world, but it is sad that one’s gratitude cannot be bestowed on worthier men than the first discoverers, that is men above quarreling over such a gift of God.”</p><p>Although the years of their marriage were overwhelmingly idyllic, the death of Little Fanny, as the child was called, from a vaguely diagnosed “congestion on the brain” 18 months later left both parents devastated, prompting Henry to write the poignant poem of loss and grief “Resignation” (1850). Fanny expressed her feelings privately in a chronicle she kept of her children’s daily activities. “My courage is almost broken,” she confided, and described how watching her daughter slowly “sinking, sinking, away from us” was a period of “agony unutterable.” She told of holding the child and hearing “the breathing shorten, then cease without a flutter,” whereupon she “cut a few locks” of hair from the child’s “holy head” and had her placed in the library “with unopened roses about her, one in her hand, that little hand which always grasped them so lovingly.” Henry recalled the loss with equal tenderness: “For a long time, I sat by her alone in the darkened library. The twilight fell softly on her placid face and the white flowers she held in her little hands. In the deep silence, the bird sang from the hall, a sad strain, a melancholy requiem. It touched and soothed me.”</p><p>“My courage is almost broken,” Fanny wrote after having watched her eighteen-month-old daughter slip away from this world.</p><p>—The Sick Child, (Madame Eugène Carrière and Son Léon), 1885, oil on canvas, 101 X 82 cm, Eugène Carrière, RMN-Grand Palais / Art Resource, NY</p><p>Everyone, at some point, must contend with the loss of loved ones from natural causes, and Fanny and Henry were no exception, their response to these sad events unfailingly expressed with grace and dignity. Nothing in their experience, however, could have prepared them for what transpired on July 9, 1861, a hot summer day when the family normally would have been enjoying the sea breezes at their summer retreat in Nahant, but were home so Fanny could be close to her dying father in Boston. After returning from a morning by Nathan Appleton’s bedside, she decided to cut some locks of hair from her seven-year-old daughter, Edith. While sealing a snippet in an envelope with wax from a lighted candle, her hooped muslin dress caught fire, setting her ablaze in an instant. Trying desperately to snuff out the flames with a small rug, Henry suffered burns on his hands and face, leaving scars that he would hide in the years ahead with the long white beard that became so familiar to his millions of admirers. Fanny survived the night, her horrible pain at length lessened by the arrival of some ether, but the injuries were too severe, and nothing further could be done. Her demeanor in these final hours was described by those in attendance as “perfectly calm, patient and gentle, all the lovely sweetness and elevation of her character showing itself in her looks and words.”</p><p>Henry was inconsolable at first, but there were several young children who needed him now more than ever. “I have never seen any one who bore a great sorrow in a more simple and noble way,” the Boston author John Lothrop Motley reported in a letter to his wife. “I hope he may find happiness in his children.” Describing his state of mind to the writer George William Curtis, who had written a moving letter of condolence, Longfellow apologized for being unable to write a fuller response. “I am too utterly wretched and overwhelmed,—to the eyes of others, outwardly calm; but inwardly bleeding to death.”</p><p>After Fanny died, Longfellow (here, c. 1861) worked through his grief by translating all three canticles of Dante’s Divine Comedy, the first American to do so. </p><p>—Courtesy of the National Park Service, Longfellow House / Washington’s Headquarters National Historic Site / catalog number LONG 35854</p><p>Over time, Henry would be productive in numerous ways, a singular achievement being his translation into English of all three canticles of Dante’s Divine Comedy, the first American to do so, and to this day greatly admired for its accuracy and fidelity to the original text. On the eighteenth anniversary of Fanny’s death, he wrote a sonnet he called “The Cross of Snow,” an extraordinary poem of loss and grief that remained unpublished during his lifetime, and gave me the title for the book I wrote about his life and his work. His death in 1882 was mourned everywhere his poems were read. He was buried in the family plot on Indian Ridge Path in Mount Auburn Cemetery, alongside his two beloved wives and his toddler daughter. His younger brother and first biographer, Samuel Longfellow, would inform a friend that the casket was decorated simply, with two palm branches and a spray of passion flowers, the symbolism of the two chosen mindfully: “He had known both the suffering and the victory.”</p><p>Nicholas A.

From the beginning, his work was innovative. He was among the first historians to mine statistics from historical records with a computer. And his insights and interpretations, notably in his classic 1967 work, “The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution,” could be groundbreaking.</p><p>On topic after topic, in more than 20 books that he wrote or edited, he shifted the direction of scholarly inquiry, in the process winning two Pulitzer Prizes, a National Book Award, a Bancroft Prize (the most prestigious award given to scholars of American history) and, in 2011, the National Humanities Medal, presented in a White House ceremony by President Barack Obama. And as a professor at Harvard for more than a half-century, he seeded many of the nation’s top university history departments with his acolytes.</p><p>“He has transformed the field of early American history as much as any single person could,” Gordon S. Wood, a historian at Brown University and a former student of Professor Bailyn’s, said in an interview for this obituary in 2008. “He transformed the history of education. He turned over our entire interpretation of the Revolution. He changed the way we think about immigration. Almost every single thing he did had a profound impact on the field.”</p><p>When Professor Bailyn entered graduate school in 1946, the field of colonial history was viewed by many as a backwater. Almost from the beginning, he brought methodological rigor and startlingly fresh interpretive questions to that endeavor.</p><p>Early in his career, he and his wife, while studying colonial-era shipping, entered statistics from Massachusetts shipping records into a primitive computer and found that Boston had one of the largest merchant fleets in the British Empire in the early 1700s, indicating a surprisingly vibrant and self-reliant economy. The resulting work, “Massachusetts Shipping, 1697-1714: A Statistical Study” (1959), was one of the first historical works to include data analyzed by a computer.</p><p>In other studies, Professor Bailyn examined specific social groups, like New England merchants — whose moneymaking, he argued, was as important to understanding the country’s origins as their Puritan religion — and the Virginia gentry.</p><p>He remains best known for “The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution,” published in 1967. It began as a bibliographical essay on hundreds of colonial pamphlets published between 1750 and 1776, which he had been charged with preparing for publication. But it grew into a sweeping study that changed the course of debate about the nation’s founding.</p><p>The book, which won both a Pulitzer and the Bancroft Prize, challenged the then-dominant view of Progressive Era historians like Charles Beard, who saw the founders’ revolutionary rhetoric as a mask for economic interests.</p><p>For Professor Bailyn, the pamphlets revealed a striking pattern. In his view, though the colonists opposed taxes, restrictions on trade and other economic measures, and were frustrated with their subordinate status in British society, it was a fundamental distrust of government power that led them to throw off the colonial yoke.</p><p>The colonists had inherited this ideology from opposition politicians and writers in England, he argued. But it became particularly potent in the relative isolation of the American colonies, where unpopular policies enacted an ocean away were interpreted as signs of a corrupt conspiracy to deny colonists their freedom.</p><p>The impact of Professor Bailyn’s book reverberated far beyond colonial history. The historian Forrest McDonald wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1990 that in the two decades after “Ideological Origins” was published, “ideological interpretation of the whole sweep of American history from the 1760s to the 1840s expanded into a veritable cottage industry.”</p><p>The book drew readers from beyond the scholarly world. A 1971 article in the The Times about Daniel Ellsberg, the leaker of the Pentagon Papers, described him pulling a copy of “Ideological Origins” the Bailyn book out of his briefcase and being moved almost to tears as he read from it.</p><p>Today, as debate over the origins and meaning of the American Revolution remains contentious, the book remains on syllabuses, drawing engagement even from younger scholars who might otherwise dismiss decades-old historical works as outmoded.</p><p>“Most of the books published in the decades after ‘Ideological Origins’ responded to it in some way — often by challenging its arguments,” the historian Mary Beth Norton, a former Bailyn student, wrote in 2017 in one of a number of round tables marking the book’s 50th anniversary. “That is a remarkable achievement for a book published half a century ago.”</p><p>Professor Bailyn was known not just for rigorous scholarship but also for his elegant prose. For him, “a kind of literary imagination” was essential to the historian’s craft.</p><p>“Like a novelist,” he wrote, the historian must conjure “a nonexistent, an impalpable world in all its living comprehension, and yet do this within the constraints of verifiable facts.”</p><p>Though he stressed the importance of narrative, he did not write to popularize history, and rarely gave interviews. But he wrote not just for scholars but also for his “better students” —non-scholars, as he put it in one of those rare interviews, in 1994, with “an active interest in history who would be sufficiently interested to read some detailed material.”</p><p>Within the profession, Professor Bailyn was a frequent critic of overspecialization, abstraction and politicized “presentism” — that is, interpreting past events in terms of modern thinking and values. For him, it was essential to respect the strangeness and pastness of the past, and to see it, as much as possible, on its own terms.</p><p>“The establishment, in some significant degree, of a realistic understanding of the past, free of myths, wish fulfillments and partisan delusions, is essential for social sanity,” he said in a 1995 lecture.</p><p>Bernard Bailyn — Bud to his friends — was born on Sept. 10, 1922, in Hartford, Conn., to Charles and Esther (Schloss) Bailyn. His father was a dentist, his mother a homemaker.</p><p>In 1940, he entered Williams College in Massachusetts, where he majored in English and dabbled in philosophy. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1945, after he had been drafted into the Army.</p><p>Growing up, he later recalled, he had not much been engaged by history. But while serving in the Signal Corps, he studied the German language and social geography. After the war, he enrolled in graduate school at Harvard.</p><p>At the time, Harvard was still a redoubt of the old WASP establishment. Professor Bailyn, who was Jewish, later recalled how one of his professors, the eminent scholar Samuel Eliot Morison, had taken little interest in him, and repeatedly confused him with a member of the Harvard Yacht Club.</p><p>By Professor Bailyn’s account, he fell into colonial history almost accidentally, driven mainly by a desire to examine, as he put it, “the connections between a distant past and an emerging modernity.”</p><p>He earned his Ph.D. in 1953 and joined the Harvard faculty. He was famous for his vivid lectures and heady if not intimidating graduate seminar, where he would punctuate wayward discussion with what the historian Jack N. Rakove recalled as “the most famous of his questions, ‘So what?’”</p><p>The book on the Revolution cemented his reputation, but Professor Bailyn continued to explore new territory and new genres. In 1975, he published “The Ordeal of Thomas Hutchinson,” a biography of the last colonial governor of Massachusetts.</p><p>The book, which won the National Book Award, was an attempt to explore, as he said, “the origins of the Revolution as experienced by the losers.” But it was read by some as a defense of the establishment — or even, some suggested, of Richard M. Nixon, who had resigned the presidency the year before the book was published — at a time of political upheaval at Harvard and across the country.</p><p>Professor Bailyn, who once described himself as “not very political,” cheerfully scoffed at the idea that he would be using Hutchinson to make a modern-day point. But he did allow that he had come to feel sympathy for Hutchinson, whom he described as “that rather stiff, intelligent, highly literate, uncorrupted, honest, upright provincial merchant-turned-judge and politician.”</p><p>In more recent decades, as interest in the experiences of women, African-Americans and other marginalized groups exploded among historians, Professor Bailyn’s name was sometimes invoked as “pejorative shorthand for an outmoded view of the past that celebrates elites,” as the historian Kenneth Owen put it in 2017.</p><p>For his part, Professor Bailyn often spoke against what he called the “fashionable” tendency to excoriate the American founders, whom he called, for all their faults, “one of the most creative groups in history.”</p><p>“They gave us the foundations of our public life,” he told an interviewer in 2010. “Their world was very different from ours, but, more than any other country, we live with their world and with what they achieved.”</p><p>Professor Bailyn won a second Pulitzer in 1987, for “Voyagers to the West,” the first volume of a series called “The Peopling of British North America,” which traces the journeys of the nearly 10,000 Britons who were known to have emigrated to America from 1773 to 1776 and explores the processes by which the colonies became a distinctly American society.</p><p>A second volume, “The Barbarous Years,” published in 2013, chronicles the chaotic, violent decades between the founding of Jamestown in 1607 and the 1675 conflict known as King Philip’s War, which effectively pushed Native Americans out of New England.</p><p>“The Barbarous Years” was a finalist for the Pulitzer, but, like “Voyagers,” it drew strong criticism from fellow historians for what they saw as inadequate or dismissive treatment of nonwhite people.</p><p>Professor Bailyn pressed on. In 1995, four years after officially retiring, he established the International Seminar on the History of the Atlantic World, an annual Harvard gathering of young scholars from around the world that is credited with helping to pioneer the now-vast field of Atlantic history.</p><p>In addition to his wife, Professor Bailyn is survived by two sons, Charles, an astronomy professor at Yale, and John, a linguistics professor at Stony Brook University on Long Island; and two granddaughters.</p><p>For all the grand sweep of his interpretations, Professor Bailyn could seem at his most exuberant when digging into the fine-grained particularities of sources, puzzling over the historical “anomalies” — a favorite Bailyn word — that they reveal.</p><p>In 2020, he published “Illuminating History: A Retrospective of Seven Decades,” an intellectual self-portrait that eschews conventional memoir in favor of a series of essays exploring some “small, strange, obscure documents and individuals” that had captured his imagination.</p><p>In an epilogue, he cautioned, as he often did, against imposing our own sense of certainty on the confusion of the past as it was actually experienced by those who lived it.</p><p>“The fact — the inescapable fact — is that we know how it all came out,” he wrote, “and they did not.”</p>\",\"date\":\"2020-8-10\",\"link\":\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/books/bernard-bailyn-dead.html\",\"discrp\":\"Bernard Bailyn, the scholar who overturned our understanding of the American Revolution, is dead at 97.\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","{\"content\":\"<p>By using this website, you consent to our use of cookies.

I’ve long insisted that it is impossible to evaluate an artwork—and especially, perhaps, if it’s a painting—without seeing it firsthand. The only exceptions are works made specifically for reproduction—in other words, certain (but not all) kinds of conceptual art, but also graphic arts, comics, and the like. Otherwise, reproductions (whether printed or digital) just don’t do the trick of communicating a work’s innate materiality, however rarefied or seemingly intangible that materiality may be. As the painter Rafael Vega recently told me, reflecting on the move by galleries to take more of their business online, “Like it or not, we need physical space to show those objects, because [paintings] exist in a real time and place. At least for now, I don’t see how online shows can do the same thing.”</p><p>Of course, I have to admit that I have not always been able to keep strictly to this rule. I’ve sat on committees and juries that have had to make decisions on awards and fellowships for artists or admissions for artists’ colonies, workshops, and MFA programs, and we’ve almost always had to make our decisions based on secondhand images of the work. We did our best, trying collectively to divine, from the colored shadows tossed on the wall by a projector and with the help, sometimes, of some words from the artist, what was being attempted and, to some degree, accomplished. But our best never really felt as good as it should be.\\n</p><p>And yet, being unable to see real works of art in person for months has made me realize just how much I have come to depend on seeing works online—and how I get more from that experience than I’d been willing to admit. I have not felt much desire to delve into the online offerings of galleries and museums, but nonetheless I have been seeing lots of art onscreen—it’s just that I’ve been getting it straight from the artists, mainly via their Instagram accounts. I’ve liked that. One reason is shyness: I don’t have to announce my having seen the work or interact with the artist if I’m not inclined to do so. In that way, looking at artists’ Instagram posts is more like visiting a gallery than visiting a studio—less personal, potentially more anonymous. And it’s a mostly visual experience; the textual dimension is secondary. Something catches your eye or it doesn’t—that’s the easy part—but when it holds your attention for more than the moment it takes to click “like,” the why and how of that hold are complicated and mysterious enough to become interesting in themselves. In other words, there’s a lot you don’t know about what you’re seeing when you see a painting online, and that sense of unknowing—of mystery—can become part of the truth of the experience.</p><p>One artist I’ve been following online for a few years is Christina Quarles. I know more about her than I do about many of the other artists whose work catches my eye on Instagram, because she’s quickly become well-known: Her art has evidently caught the eye of quite a few people. Since graduating from Yale’s MFA program in 2016, she’s exhibited widely, not only in Los Angeles, where she now lives, but as far afield as Shanghai and London; an exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in her hometown, Chicago, should have opened in April, but was postponed until next year. Her exhibitions (not only in prominent galleries but in museums such as the Hepworth Wakefield in West Yorkshire, England, and the Berkeley Art Museum & Pacific Film Archive) have been widely covered in the press, especially in the United Kingdom. She has not yet had a solo show in New York, so I’ve never seen anything of hers in person.</p><p>Quarles’s style could be called a kind of twisted figuration—unless it’s quite the opposite, a form of abstraction pushed against its inclination to become figurative. It seems to reflect a half-dystopian, half-hedonistic intuition that the body’s plasticity might be far more radical than everyday experience suggests. One can see her work as part of a tradition that encompasses Francis Bacon’s desire to create figures that might be, as he once said, “made out of something, which is completely irrational from the point of view of being an illustration,” or of André Masson’s automatist paintings with their metamorphizing of animal/human forms, but there is a distinctly contemporary cool to her interpretation of this figurative legacy, which could just as easily be compared to the way certain electronic music producers compose their pieces out of cut-up bits of other songs that feel familiar, though, because they’ve been slowed down or sped up, you can’t quite recognize them. And because I know from what I’ve read about Quarles that she identifies as biracial and queer, I can understand that her impulse to reinvent the image of the body might have a political dimension.\\n</p><p>On May 22, Quarles posted a new painting, made in quarantine, titled Behold! And Be Held Beside Me. It shows a blurry-faced, purplish-hued figure lying prone, knees up, in a field of flowers. The figure, of indeterminate gender, has weirdly twisted legs and long, long, rubbery arms hanging down in front of a white picket fence. Behind we glimpse three heads and a pair of arms hugging. Are they the dream of the apparently sleeping figure in the foreground? Sweetness and grotesquerie coexist in the imagery but also in Quarles’s almost too rich palette. The hues of the heads and bodies, as well as of the flowers, seem to blur translucently into one another like watercolor, while those of the background landscape—earth and foliage simplified into a sequence of curving reddish-brown and green stripes with a strip of blue at the top—and the white fence in front are opaque, their forms more crisply defined. The white, I can tell even from the digital image, is textured, perhaps slightly impastoed. Are the other colors painted as thinly and smoothly as they look to me, or if I could see the work in person, would they have a similar tactility? My longing to see the painting closely is both an element in the ambivalent pleasure I nonetheless derive from its bodiless image and a kind of promise that the real painting has something more to offer—that it does not just picture a body but somehow is a body, that it does not exist merely for the sake of the image it bears.\\n</p><p>Another Los Angeles–based painter I’ve been following, though not as long, is Andrea Marie Breiling. Since getting her MFA from the Claremont Graduate University in 2014, she’s shown mostly with LA galleries, but also with one in Düsseldorf, Germany. But there’s not much information on her in circulation—no interviews or articles that I can find, just a brief quote on the Facebook page of a gallery where she was in a group show: “I work abstractly so it’s about composition and color and you have to think about it like mathematics. But when I’m finished with the work I want it to become a memorial for a time or place. It’s a moment of meditation to create something using color and materials .” I don’t even know when she was born, though I know that it happened in Phoenix.\\n</p><p>The first paintings of Breiling’s that I noticed, probably around 2018, seemed to derive from a European approach to abstraction. I thought, for instance, of the Danish artist Per Kirkeby or of the later work of Günther Förg in Germany—a kind of roughed-up painterliness, with conglomerations of vibrantly colored brush marks refusing to meld into distinct forms but retaining their separate identities against a ground of bare canvas. Despite her professedly mathematical approach to structure, Breiling’s touch communicates urgency. The paintings attracted me, but only more recently did they begin to fascinate me, when I noticed a change in their character. The new works feature a different kind of mark making, less scruffy and agitated and less likely to gravitate together into dense clumps. Now the paintings are dominated by more extended linear gestures, often in concentric, diamond-like formations counterpoised to an armature of central horizontal and vertical lines—all this in a combination of thickly painted strokes and what appears to be spray paint. Even more of the canvas has been left unpainted; the colors are brighter, clearer; all in all, there is a sense of lightness and speed new to the artist’s work. A clear, simple structure allows for great freedom, a sense of “everything goes,” and it’s wonderfully exhilarating.\\n</p><p>So exhilarating is the feeling I get from Breiling’s work, even just on the screen, that when I began to think about writing this essay and sorting through my ideas about which artists to include, she was the first one I thought of. But using social media as a repository of memories has its drawbacks: When I went to her profile to take another look at the images that had made such an impression on me, they were all gone. She’d removed everything except images related to Black Lives Matter. So I wrote to ask her to send me some images to mull over. Now we’re in touch—I’ve never had any direct contact with the other artists I’m discussing here—and so the potential transiency of digital images has turned from a drawback into an opportunity to learn more. But even at secondhand, as seen through my phone, Breiling’s art shows a radiance and vitality that speaks for itself; it tells me there’s something there, even if I can’t quite make out, at this distance, what it is.\\n</p><p>It’s only been this year that I’ve noticed the work of Maja Ruznic. She was born in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1983. After civil war broke out nine years later, she and her mother spent three years moving through various refugee camps before landing in the United States. In 2009 she received an MFA from the California College of the Arts in San Francisco, and she now lives in Roswell, N.M. Since 2012 she’s had solo shows at small galleries in Stockholm, Los Angeles, and Sarajevo, among other places, but most often in Dallas. And she seems to be on the verge of becoming still better known, as her online bio includes upcoming shows with dates still to be determined—presumably delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic—at prominent galleries in London and New York. And it’s not only about art that I learn from Instagram: I can also see that since I started working on this article, Ruznic has become a mother.\\t\\t\\t\\t</p><p>Ruznic’s paintings are pretty hard to “read” online, and yet their unfathomability is part of what drew me to them: There’s a dreamy, quasi-Symbolist vibe to her figurative compositions, through which diaphanous personae float. To quote a poem by Charles Simic from which she drew the title of “My Noiseless Entourage,” her exhibition earlier this year at the Conduit Gallery in Dallas, her work is “like a discreet entourage / Of homegrown angels and demons / All of whom I had met before / And had since largely forgotten .” I’d be most curious to see the surfaces of these paintings up close: From what I can tell from the jpegs, the pigment seems rubbed into the canvas in sparse quantities, but some passages look quite dry and powdery and others more fluid, almost molten. Figures melt into each other and into the space they inhabit. The boundaries between forms are permeable, uncertain. So are the narratives in mind for her paintings. Instead the accent, or perhaps the narrative she wants to put across, is on the idea that there are goings-on in the world that are inaccessible to a purely empirical perception—soul events, you might say.\\n</p><p>If that kind of language sets off alarms, I understand. This work might be hovering on the edge of being too fey for its own good. Are the paintings stuck in a nebulous dreamworld? It’s precisely their ambiguity that reassures me that if I could see them in person, I’d find them convincing. It seems that these unspoken spectacles derive more from Ruznic’s exploration of her materials than from a predetermination to put a certain message across, and that very fact, paradoxically, means that there is a fundamental physical reality, accessible to touch and vision, underwriting whatever spiritual message I imagine being communicated. The artist is not pretending to know more than she really can know. On Instagram, Ruznic posts close-up details more often than entire paintings, as if to emphasize that the work’s truth is in its materiality—and that every painting contains within itself a multitude of possible paintings.\\n</p><p>Seemingly at an opposite pole from Ruznic’s tenuous phantasmatic visions is the often ferocious, sometimes grotesque pictorial imagination of Peter Williams. He’s an artist that I didn’t discover via social media—though I follow him now on Instagram—but in a more old-fashioned way: I saw a painting of his, earlier this year, reproduced on a book’s cover. The book is a new novel by one of my very favorite writers, Lynn Crawford’s Paula Regossy, but the cover image so fascinated me that I almost had to force myself to move past it to the book’s interior. The painting, in what I’d call an almost aggressively fruity palette, seemed to be a sort of abstract equivalent to an M.C. Escher image, endlessly twisting itself around itself in some impossible way. It was precisely this sense of impossibility, and of a kind of self-enclosed endlessness, that sent my brain into overdrive and that also—once I finally forced myself to get past the cover to read the book itself—seemed a perfect complement for Crawford’s simultaneously blunt and evasive mix of fantasy and realism, much influenced by the structural gamesmanship of the French OuLiPo group. The name of Crawford’s protagonist turns out to be an anagram of the name of the James Bond character that Williams used as the title of his painting: Pussy Galore. Paula Regossy is a spy story too, but of a very different kind from Ian Fleming’s.\\n</p><p>What I know about Williams from searching on the Internet is that he is an African American in his late 60s, living in Wilmington, Del., where he teaches at a state university. He has a substantial national exhibition history, including several shows in New York that I somehow missed—the most recent at the Cue Art Foundation in 2018. More typical of Williams’s work than Pussy Galore are figurative paintings that I see in the lineage of Peter Saul and Robert Colescott going back to, maybe, James Ensor and Otto Dix—painters ruthless in their use of humor, exaggeration, and even vulgarity to skewer the wrongs and follies of society. The disruptive energy of Williams’s art is probably best encapsulated by the title of his current exhibition (through October 10) at Paul Kotula Projects in Ferndale, Mich., in the Detroit metropolitan area: “Peter Williams: Mass Murder .”\\n</p><p>The one thing Williams’s figurative paintings share with his abstractions is their intense, assertive, joyously inharmonious color. The compositions are crowded and raucous and sometimes feature a Black everyman figure who is both protagonist and witness: a worried-looking superhero dressed in an orange uniform emblazoned with a big “N” above “WORD” in smaller print. Perhaps not surprisingly, among the newest pieces I’ve seen on Williams’s Instagram feed are two captioned The arrest of George Floyd, posted June 12, and The ascention of St. George Floyd posted July 10. There’s no superhero in sight in these paintings. In The arrest, the central figure is trapped within a kind of abstract geometrical structure (not so distant from something one might see in one of Williams’s abstract works), where he is held in place by a plethora of white hands grabbing at his legs, torso, arms, and head, although those hands seem to have no reality except when they have their grip on him. At the lower edges of the painting are a pair of inset heads—black on the left, white on the right—both apparently behind prison bars. Around these heads are inscriptions pointing to millions of guilty whites, millions of imprisoned blacks. In The ascention, wearing a halo that seems to double as a space helmet, he appears to be taking off, arms stretched out like a dancer’s and with just one foot still on this blue planet, into a solar realm where the angels (or possibly ancestors) are prepared to receive him. One online interlocutor gave a thumbs-up to “All those angels,” and the artist responded, “I hope, could be some white debil’s [sic].” There is a terrible tenderness to this painting, and maybe it has to do with that apprehension that oppression might continue even in the beyond.\\n</p><p>There’s good reason to maintain some doubt about what you’re really seeing when you see a painting onscreen and to be suspicious of art that’s easily consumed in that mode. It might easily be what the critic Rob Colvin dismissed a few years ago as “Like Art ”: that is, “art that looks very much like art you’ve already seen, that you know very well, and that you already like” and is momentarily pleasing—gets a lot of “likes”—for just that reason. But just as when you see it on the wall in a gallery, a painting that raises more questions than it answers online might well have staying power. Williams’s paintings are anything but easygoing or ingratiating. I’m hoping to commune with them in person—and the same goes for the work of Quarles, Breiling, and Ruznic—if ever fate allows it.\\n\\t</p><p>\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tIn order to comment, you must be logged in as a paid subscriber. Click here to log in or subscribe.\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSign up for our free daily newsletter, along with occasional offers for programs that support our journalism.

Who are their equivalents today?                </p><p>John Peter, chief theatre critic at The Sunday Times for almost twenty years, died last month.  A Hungarian refugee who fled to Britain after the 1956 Uprising, he was a deeply civilised man and will be much missed. </p><p>Peter worked at The Sunday Times from 1967 until 2010. Looking back, it was a golden age of theatre criticism when critics like Michael Billington, Benedict Nightingale and Charles Spencer were at their peak. All four retired in the last ten years. We have not seen their like since. </p><p>‘One of the most characteristic sounds of the English Sunday,’ wrote Penelope Gilliatt, in 1959, ‘is that of Harold Hobson barking up the wrong tree.’ If that was what she made of the drama critic who championed Godot and The Birthday Party, what would she have made of today’s younger theatre critics? Reading what passes for reviews in some of our newspapers and weeklies, it looks as if theatre criticism in Britain is heading for a complete breakdown. </p><p>Of course, we can disagree about particular plays and productions. That is what drives theatre criticism. Harold Hobson raved about the first performance of The Birthday Party; other critics loathed it. Look Back in Anger received mixed reviews when it opened, and Tynan praised it to the skies. However, you need some kind of shared language to begin a conversation. </p><p>The critic can be on the side of the reader and be at home in a two- hundred-year tradition of theatre criticism that goes back to Hazlitt, Tynan and Shaw. The editors seem to miss this basic point and so that tradition is in danger of coming to an end.</p><p>What is striking is how recent all this is. A few years ago, a poll in Whatsonstage.com asked theatregoers to vote for the critics they most trust. The top five were Michael Billington of The Guardian (39%), Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph (23%), John Peter of The Sunday Times (19%), Michael Coveney of The Daily Mail and Nicholas de Jongh of The Standard (both 10%). The youngest of these five critics was almost fifty. The others were all born either side of the Second World War. Except for Spencer, all of them started in the 1970s and early ‘80s, a very different cultural moment. </p><p>That generation, has come to an end. Jack Tinker, Bernard Levin, John Peter, John Gross and Milton Shulman have all died. Michael Billington and Nightingale have retired. Who will replace them? </p><p>Of course, there have been other key moments in the history of theatre criticism when one generation has given way to another. The history of the revolution in British theatre in the 1950s cannot properly be understood without bearing this in mind. New critics, crucially Hobson and Tynan, made their reputations by championing new kinds of theatre – Waiting for Godot (1955), Look Back in Anger (1956), the Berliner Ensemble’s production of Mother Courage (1956), The Birthday Party (1958). The changing of the guard did not lead to dumbing down. It brought about some of the best criticism written, passionately defending new kinds of drama and major new voices.</p><p>This generation too came to an end in the 1960s and ‘70s. Tynan left The Observer (1963), Worsley stopped writing theatre criticism after 17 years (1965) and eventually Hobson ended almost thirty years at The Sunday Times. Another new, younger generation emerged: Irving Wardle at The Times (1963), Benedict Nightingale at The New Statesman (1968), Billington at The Guardian (1971), Sheridan Morley at Punch, and James Fenton, then John Peter at The Sunday Times. These were exciting times in British theatre: Peter Hall at the National, Richard Eyre at the Nottingham Playhouse, new writers like Stoppard and Ayckbourn, Edgar, Griffiths and Hare, new actors like Callow, Rickman and Shaw, Stevenson, McKellen and Sher. The new critics knew and cared about theatre. They championed their favourites, did their best – in Kathleen Tynan’s words – to ‘make permanent the impermanent’, and wrote clear, decent criticism.</p><p>Now, as that generation, too, has passed, the signs are worrying. It is hard to think of a leading critic under fifty. There is no new generation in sight. This is unprecedented. Billington was barely thirty when he began at The Guardian, older than Nightingale when he started at The Statesman. Much is made of the fact that Tynan took over at The Observer when he was 27, but Hobson was only 31 when he began as a theatre critic and James Agate was 30 when he began at The Guardian. Beerbohm was younger still, 26, when he began at The Saturday Review in 1898, and Shaw, his predecessor, was not yet forty when he became a theatre critic. Going further back still, Hazlitt was in his thirties when he first saw Kean’s debut as Shylock in 1814. The great critics, in short, always began before they were forty. Who are their equivalents today? Where are the new, young voices in theatre criticism?</p><p>Tynan became the best-known theatre critic of his time because he wrote superbly. For example, on Anna Neagle in The Glorious Days: ‘she sings, shaking her voice at the audience like a tiny fist…’ Or his response to Godot: it ‘jettisons everything by which we recognise theatre. It arrives at the custom-house, as it were, with no luggage, no passport and nothing to declare…’ Reviewing The Quare Fellow, he wrote, ‘Behan’s tremendous new language is out on a spree, ribald, dauntless and spoiling for a fight…’ </p><p>Hobson was Hal to Tynan’s Hotspur. Less flair, fewer political histrionics. Consider, however, the intelligence at work in his reaction to Peter Hall’s first production of Godot: ‘Mr Beckett has any amount of swagger. A dusty, coarse, irreverent, pessimistic, violent swagger? Possibly. But the genuine thing, the real McCoy.’ Or his historic defence of Pinter’s The Birthday Party in 1958, when all the other critics had damned it and it was playing to an empty house: ‘I am willing to stake whatever reputation I have as a judge of plays by saying that The Birthday Party is not a Fourth, not even a Second, but a First; and that Mr. Pinter, on the evidence of this work, possesses the most original, disturbing, and arresting talent in theatrical London.’ </p><p>Hobson and Tynan are the last theatre critics to feature in the new Dictionary of National Biography because they wrote well and championed the new. They weren’t simply chroniclers, they made different kinds of theatre possible. Confronted with the strangely new, they tried to make sense of it, and when they felt – as with Osborne and Pinter, Beckett and the Berliner Ensemble – that they were encountering something extraordinary, they fought for it with tremendous passion.</p><p>Reading those first reviews, you feel as if you are sitting in on history.  Of course, they made mistakes. All critics do. They sometimes barked up the wrong tree, but they brought theatre to life. They tried to think through the unprecedented revolution in British theatre that was going on around them.  </p><p>Does this matter? Do we need critics to be anything but entertaining or informative? Yes, because in several crucial respects theatre in Britain is embattled today as never before. Of course, there is Coronavirus which has left theatres on their knees. But British theatre had its problems long before the health crisis. First, there is the sheer cost of going to the West End today. Despite welcome initiatives as at the National, it’s hard to get two good seats in the West End for much under £100, and if you’re making an evening of it, that may be only half of your expenditure for a night out. That is more than a year’s TV licence or a dozen trips to the cinema. </p><p>Second, theatre is scorned by the chattering classes in a way that cinema or television are not. For some time, more of my conversations with friends have been about what we have senes on Netflix, Amazon Prime or BBC iPlayer rather than the Old Vic or the Royal Court. Television coverage is an interesting indicator. For years, British television respectfully filmed theatrical productions. It was arguably the BBC showing an extract of Look Back in Anger on 16th October 1956 that really launched Osborne’s play. Box office-takings almost doubled, from £900 to £1,700 per week. The next month, the play was televised at peak viewing by ITV, giving a huge audience access to one of the most controversial new plays. Ian McKellen’s reputation took off when the BBC showed his Richard II and Marlowe’s Edward II with the Prospect Theatre Company in 1968. Channel 4 televised the RSC’s Nicholas Nickleby and the exciting new productions of Lyubimov in the mid-‘80s. Simon Curtis’ Performance series introduced a number of key contemporary plays to a television audience in the 1990s. That link is broken. Apart from Richard Eyre’s series on 20th century drama, BBC 1 and 2 and Channel 4 have abandoned theatre. </p><p>But as National Theatre Live on You Tube has shown there have been terrific productions over the past twenty years. Gillian Anderson as Blanche Dubois in Streetcar, Helen McCrory in Rattigan’s Deep Blue Sea and Nigel Hawthorne as George III, Nick Hytner’s One Man, Two Guv’nors and his recent Midsummer Night’s Dream, Simon Godwin’s Twelfth Night at the National and Patrick Stewart in Rupert Goold’s Macbeth. There was the hugely ambitious Pinter season two years ago, Patrick Marber’s revival of Travesties, also in 2018, and terrific new plays like Lucy Prebble’s ENRON, Lucy Kirkwood’s Chimerica, Martin McDonagh’s Hangmen, Oslo and The Lehman Trilogy, all produced in the last ten years, all hugely ambitious.  </p><p>Theatre, in short, takes on what television and film rarely dare to – topical political polemics (Stuff Happens), the responsibility of scientists in a nuclear age (Copenhagen), the discussion of complicated ideas (Arcadia). It keeps alive the distant past in an amnesiac culture (from Greek tragedy to Shakespeare and Racine), and the recent past (Daldry’s revival of Wesker’s The Kitchen and Priestley’s An Inspector Calls). It tries to keep alive different kinds of language (from the lyricism of Jim Cartwright’s Road to Kushner’s Angels in America. It rejects insularity and parochialism, by bringing in productions from all around the world, from Mukiyama’s Japan to Jatinder Verma’s work with Tara Arts.</p><p>Theatre does this in the face of an increasingly intolerant culture, which aches for the familiar and the parochial. In the 1890s, it was Archer and Shaw who championed Ibsenism. In the 1950s, Tynan and Hobson defended Beckett, Pinter and Brecht. In the 1970s and ‘80s, Billington, Nightingale and Peter defended The Romans in Britain and Bent. Today there is a real danger that editors, dumbing down, will look for new kinds of celebrity-critics, who know little and care less about theatre, who write badly and think timidly. Who, then, will champion the new and the bold, in an increasingly conformist climate?</p><p>The passing of a golden age of theatre critics is symptomatic of the decline of the British press. It’s not just the circulations in complete free fall or the thinness of the new Guardian. It’s the middlebrow nature of arts pages, barely recognisable from twenty years ago. The New Statesman doesn’t even have a theatre critic any more. At a moment of crisis, British theatre has never needed the passionate and informed support of great theatre critics more, supported by editors who believe theatre matters.  </p><p>As Alan Bennett’s Talking Heads is set to air this evening, Alexander Larman ponders the relationship between a living writer and their works</p><p>Nicola Sturgeon runs rings around her Scottish opponents.

In a letter to the British Journal of Astrology dated February 8, 1918, he wrote that there were only two dates he remembered with absolute precision: July 13, 1893, the date of his father’s death from tuberculosis when Pessoa was only five; and December 30, 1895, the day his mother remarried, which meant that, shortly afterward, the family moved to Durban, where his new stepfather had been appointed Portuguese consul. In that same letter, Pessoa mentions a third date, too: August 20, 1905, the day he left South Africa and returned to Lisbon for good.</p><p>That first brief period was marked by two losses: the deaths of his father and of a younger brother. And perhaps a third loss, too: that of his beloved Lisbon. During the second period, despite knowing only Portuguese when he arrived in Durban, Pessoa rapidly became fluent in English and in French. </p><p>He was clearly not the average student. When asked years later, a fellow pupil described Pessoa as “a little fellow with a big head. He was brilliantly clever but quite mad.” In 1902, just six years after arriving in Durban, he won first prize for an essay on the British historian Thomas Babington Macaulay. Indeed, he appeared to spend all his spare time reading or writing, and had already begun creating the fictional alter egos, or, as he later described them, heteronyms, for which he is now so famous, writing stories and poems under such names as Karl P. Effield, David Merrick, Charles Robert Anon, Horace James Faber, Alexander Search, and more. In their recent book Eu sou uma antologia (I am an anthology), Jerónimo Pizarro and Patricio Ferrari list 136 heteronyms, giving biographies and examples of each fictitious author’s work. In 1928, Pessoa wrote of the heteronyms: “They are beings with a sort-of-life-of-their-own, with feelings I do not have, and opinions I do not accept. While their writings are not mine, they do also happen to be mine.”</p><p>The third period of Pessoa’s life began when, at the age of seventeen, he returned alone to Lisbon and never went back to South Africa. He returned ostensibly to attend college. For various reasons, though—among them, ill health and a student strike—he abandoned his studies in 1907 and became a regular visitor to the National Library, where he resumed his regime of voracious reading—philosophy, sociology, history, and in particular, Portuguese literature. He lived initially with his aunts and, later, from 1909 onward, in rented rooms. In 1907, his grandmother left him a small inheritance and in 1909 he used that money to buy a printing press for the publishing house, Empreza Íbis, that he set up a few months later. Empreza Íbis closed in 1910, having published not a single book. From 1912 onward, Pessoa began contributing essays to various journals; from 1915, with the creation of the literary magazine Orpheu, which he cofounded with a group of artists and poets including Almada Negreiros and Mário de Sá-Carneiro, he became part of Lisbon’s literary avant-garde and was involved in various ephemeral literary movements such as Intersectionism and Sensationism. Alongside his day job as a freelance commercial translator between English and French, he also wrote for numerous journals and newspapers and translated Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter, short stories by O. Henry, and poems by Edgar Allan Poe, as well as continuing to write voluminously in all genres. Very little of his own poetry or prose was published in his lifetime: just one slender volume of poems in Portuguese, Mensagem (Message), and four chapbooks of English poetry. When Pessoa died in 1935, at the age of forty-seven, he left behind the famous trunks (there are at least two) stuffed with writings—nearly thirty thousand pieces of paper—and only then, thanks to his friends and to the many scholars who have since spent years excavating that archive, did he come to be recognized as the prolific genius he was.</p><p>Pessoa lived to write, typing or scribbling on anything that came to hand—scraps of paper, envelopes, leaflets, advertising flyers, the backs of business letters, et cetera. He also wrote in almost every genre—poetry, prose, drama, philosophy, criticism, political theory—as well as developing a deep interest in occultism, theosophy, and astrology. He drew up horoscopes not only for himself and his friends but also for many dead writers and historical figures, among them Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, and Robespierre, as well as for his heteronyms, a term he eventually chose over pseudonym because it more accurately described their stylistic and intellectual independence from him, their creator, and from each other—for he gave them all complex biographies and they all had their own distinctive styles and philosophies. They sometimes interacted, even criticizing or translating each other’s work. Some of Pessoa’s fictitious writers were mere sketches, some wrote in English and French, but his three main poetic heteronyms—Alberto Caeiro, Ricardo Reis, Álvaro de Campos—wrote only in Portuguese, and each produced a very solid body of work.</p><p>The award-winning translator Margaret Jull Costa lives in England.
