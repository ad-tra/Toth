His robust presence, which commanded any room back then, was incompatible with the idea of his shrinking into doddering frailty. But Brodsky was both young and old. His energy, his probing mind, the rakish slant of his shoulders, his reach-for-the-rafters poetry readings—these qualities kept him ever clothed in the semblance of youth, a boy genius in secondhand jackets that looked as if they came off the rack wrinkled and ink stained, yet draping him like a monument. But he also seemed old. Watching him chain-smoke Kent III cigarettes, having first bitten off the filter, despite two bypass surgeries, made his death from a heart attack in 1996 at age 55 seem a terminus already ticketed. And long before ill health carved a certain tiredness around the eyes, he exuded the aura of someone who had lived more deeply than most, been through much more. His slate-blue peepers looked not only across rooms, but centuries.</p><p>This gaze suggests the mien behind his poetry. Even when they first appeared, Brodsky’s poems spoke to the moment, but also through it. At the conclusion of “Eclogue IV: Winter,” translated from the Russian by himself, he captures the passing feel of writing on a page while also making the case for its permanence:</p><p>The urge to consciously speak across time, coupled with Brodsky’s ability to inject his own speaking presence into the poems, accounts for their high degree of self-reflexivity. As he writes in “A Part of Speech,” the poem that more than any other placed him on the world stage, “What gets left of a man amounts / to a part. To his spoken part. To a part of speech.” Throughout his poems he makes constant reference to the fleeting and visceral act of speech itself, so much so that it is often hard to know where the man stops and the poem begins. Because Brodsky seems to be talking out loud in his poems, they can feel more recorded than written, no matter their loyalty to rhyme and meter. His friend and fellow Nobel laureate Derek Walcott shared his fondness for allusions to the pen crossing the page, but for Brodsky, the poem becomes a theater in which he commands center stage, drawing the reader in not just as a reader but also as a spectator at a drama.</p><p>As with Walt Whitman, Brodsky’s persona fuels the engine of his poems. The difference is that whereas Whitman wished to infuse a single individual with a collective consciousness, Brodsky was bent on describing, free of cant or self-justification, not only what it means to be a human being but also what it means to be <em>this</em> human being. Persecuted and interrogated by the Soviets, twice thrown into mental institutions, and finally denounced and sentenced in 1964 to five years’ hard labor in the Arctic (though released after 18 months), he’d already had quite the life before he was “invited” to leave Russia for good in 1972. As his mentor Anna Akhmatova quipped, “What a biography they’re fashioning for our red-haired friend!” Though the psychological and physical toll was no doubt staggering, he rarely spoke of it. But what had happened to this human being was enough to destroy almost anyone.</p><p>I met him in 1981, when I took his poetry seminar in the graduate writing program at Columbia, but really it was years before that I had dipped into his <em>Selected Poems</em> of 1973, and then most pointedly into <em>A Part of Speech</em> when it was published in 1980. The opening of the latter’s title poem still rests in my ear to this day in George L. Kline’s translation:</p><p>Just months out of college, reading this at night after spending my days building stone walls in a terraced garden in Wales, I felt transported. Here was a poet who in only a few lines could wed nature, birth, rhymes, and the speaking voice, all of it laced with a melancholy born of the lament laid down in Kline’s translation of “Odysseus to Telemachus”:</p><p>Given that I was the son of a truck driver and the sole sibling or cousin to earn a BA degree, and that I wrote poems, had traveled in Europe, and had no prospects of a job or career, it might be tempting to read something Oedipal into my response. But I was not out to slay the father, or even to deny my own, whom I loved dearly. Rather, I felt the desire to become a different kind of son, to serve something larger, something older. A few months later, I turned in my mason’s trowel for a plane ticket, headed home, and applied to Columbia.</p><p>There, in what can only be described as the Soviet glumness of Dodge Hall, Brodsky would hold forth for two hours each Tuesday. Hardy, Frost, Cavafy, and Auden were the main fare, as well as Wilfred Owen, Osip Mandelstam, and Marina Tsvetaeva. Brodsky was not the most elegant of classroom managers, to say the least. His method mainly consisted of asking a question for which he clearly had the answer, and then proceeding to quietly reply to any student response with either “Garbage” or “Pretty good.” (I once received a “Pretty good—in fact, that’s <em>awfully</em> good!” at which point it felt as if the heavens would burst into chorus.) Described this way, Brodsky’s method sounds like a nightmare, and I’m sure for some it was, but for many of us the performance was mesmerizing.</p><p>From three to five P.M. on those darkening fall afternoons, we felt that we were not so much in the presence of a poet, and certainly not an academic or a scholar, as of poetry itself. Nothing of this man’s thinking was held back, and it seemed as if he were making his case for poetry to the spheres rather than to a roomful of graduate students. Yes, he could be rude, and no, none of us ever got our essays back with any kind of useful comments, if we got them back at all. And he could be wrongheaded (his case for reading Frost’s “Home Burial” as a tragic rendering of Pygmalion’s love for Galatea seemed a stretch) or even flat wrong (Brecht and Neruda are not second-rate poets—they were just Marxists; Nabokov is not a “failed poet,” just a fellow genius of a different stripe). But once you found your way past the manner, you got to the matter: a whole and almost molecular engagement with what poetry can be, why it matters, and why it is the very manna of thought and feeling when read seriously.</p><p>This kind of gravitas remains the central attraction of Brodsky’s verse. He pegged poetry as “the supreme form of human locution in any culture,” representing “not even a form of art, but our anthropological, genetic goal, our linguistic, evolutionary beacon” (from his essay “An Immodest Proposal”). Although these ideals might seem too lofty for the marginalized art of poetry to bear up under today, they were at the core of what he felt to be his charge as a teacher. Agree with him or not on any particular poet or poem, there was no ignoring what he handed over freely to his class, and what he cites elsewhere in the same essay, namely, that poetry “is the only insurance available against the vulgarity of the human heart.” Reading poetry, “you become what you read, you become the state of the language which is a poem, and its epiphany or its revelation is yours,” and the same could be said for his teaching.</p><p>Revelation is what his poems still offer. This seductive quality helped seal Brodsky’s standing in the 1980s, especially after the publication of <em>A Part of Speech.</em> In “Lullaby of Cape Cod,” one of his best poems, beautifully rendered in English by Anthony Hecht, Brodsky’s voice is front and center when he observes, “The change of Empires is intimately tied / to the hum of words, the soft, fricative spray / of spittle in the act of speech.” A few lines later, however, a shift occurs from the act of speech to the poet’s own immediate bodily presence:</p><p>Notice how he moves from the eye to the mirror, to the part in the hair, to the gums, heart, mind, and finally, and pointedly, to the blank page on which he writes, perhaps, the lines we are reading. A couple of pages later in this long, marvelous poem, this implied inner voyeurism turns into the full-fledged assertion of the poet speaking and writing in unison:</p><p>If this were not enough to allow the reader to inhabit the poet sitting at his desk, the poem hands itself off to the reader more and more as it progresses, especially when Brodsky asks us to</p><p>The poem, having traced the evolution of the poet’s speech in attaining landfall through “the scrawl of a pen,” invokes our own evolution as well. The illusion is that we are no longer just readers of the poem, but rather a part of the poem, Brodsky’s inner monologue and thoughts played out as if our very own voice were speaking to ourselves. Indeed, “Lullaby of Cape Cod” may essentially be about a poet talking to himself inside a room, but what a room it is. If its 412 lines were not enough to demand our total immersion, its journey into and through the void epitomizes what Brodsky felt was the core strength of American poetry as set down by Frost in “A Servant to Servants,” namely, that “the best way out is always through” (quoted in Brodsky’s essay “Speech at the Stadium” and elsewhere). The poem shows him not only at the height of his powers but also having conquered the dire circumstances of exile, grief, and loss that would have derailed most other people.</p><p>This drive carried over to the classroom. As one cold December day faded into night outside Dodge Hall, he got to the end of two hours on Frost and said to the class, “I need another hour, who can stay?” Half my classmates reached for their coats and knapsacks, but the rest of us settled in. What followed, however, was not a class but an hour-long monologue, Brodsky’s brow breaking into sweat as he dragged hard on those Kent IIIs and conversed with the back of tomorrow. Much of what he said can be found in the title essay of his 1995 collection <em>On Grief and Reason</em>. That essay focuses exclusively on “Home Burial” and Brodsky’s insistence that</p><p>Quite the reading of Frost, one might say, but the credibility of it in relation to Frost is not the point. Instead, it is Brodsky’s reading of Frost, and not just of him, but of poetry itself, one forged with a passion and a laser-like gaze that cuts away the fat in order to get right down to what Brodsky saw as the poem’s muscle.</p><p>He did this with a number of Frost’s poems on that night until, exhausted, as if at last freed of all he had to say on the matter, he stopped. Taking a sip of coffee, he scanned the dozen or so faces still in the room before beginning with the “Vwell, vwell, vwell …” he so frequently used as a stopgap in which to load up his next thought. In this case: “Some of you will go on to become poets, though many of you will not, for that’s just what comes to pass and what statistics tell us. But there is one thing that all of you must do and that is be grateful for this language!” His eyes glistening, his hand resting on the collected Frost as if it were a Bible, that was it, the clear implication being that we should be grateful for Frost and for the English language itself.</p><p>As elementary a lesson as that may sound, it is rare to have it delivered so directly and with such passion, as well as for it to be allowed to hover in the air at the end of three hours. Brodsky’s flair for the dramatic was a pedagogical tool, for his thinking on poetry and much else was so singular, so surprising, and at times so strange that there was never a conversation to be had with him in which I didn’t learn something, nor did I have to agree with that something in order to learn, because what he set in motion above all else was thought itself. Not the limits of a meager idea, but the activity of thought itself. And that was what was so freeing, why there was more oxygen in the room when Brodsky was in it, and what I kept returning to in the years to come.</p><p>That same night after his aria on Frost, as we walked out of Dodge Hall, I had the audacity to ask if he might want to go for a drink. “Let’s try it!” he offered, and before I knew it, I was sitting at a table in a bar across the street, waiting for Brodsky to collect our drinks and wondering, what the hell am I going to say now? Wisely, I started with the only thing I could think of: “What should I read?”</p><p>Nodding his head in approval, he asked for pen and paper, and there in a little notebook I carried around he scribbled down a list: Edwin Arlington Robinson, Weldon Kees (underlined), Ovid, Horace, Virgil, Catullus, minor Alexandrian poets, Paul Celan, Peter Huchel, Georg Trakl (underlined), Antonio Machado, Umberto Saba, Eugenio Montale (underlined), Andrew Marvell, Ivor Gurney, Patrick Kavanagh, Douglas Dunne, Zbigniew Herbert (underlined), Vasco Popa, Vladimir Holan, Ingeborg Bachmann, “Gilgamesh,” Randall Jarrell, Vachel Lindsay, Theodore Roethke, Edgar Lee Masters, Howard Nemerov, Max Jacob, Thomas Trahern, and then a short list of essayists: Hannah Arendt, William Hazlitt, George Orwell, Elias Canetti (underlined and <em>Crowds and Power</em> added), E. M. Cioran (<em>Temptation to Exist</em> added), and finally the poet Les Murray added in my own hand after he suggested it. The sheet of paper, roughly the size of an iPhone but, as Brodsky would say, with far more and far greater information stored within it, remains tucked away inside my copy of <em>A Part of Speech</em> to this day.</p><p>What else we talked about I cannot remember, but a friendship had blossomed. The following year several fellow students approached me to ask if I might inquire whether Brodsky would be willing to do a tutorial on Russian poetry with us. Not only did he agree, but he insisted that we come to his Greenwich Village apartment on Morton Street each Sunday night, where he handed out mimeographs of translations of 19th-century Russian poets—V. A. Zhukovsky, E. A. Baratynsky, F. I. Tyutchev, Pushkin, and others—which later turned into <em>An Age Ago,</em> the anthology translated by Alan Myers with an introduction by Brodsky. In it he writes,</p><p>Sunday nights at Joseph’s house, indeed! You didn’t ask that many questions, you just wrote in a notebook as fast as you could. And how freeing it all was, and how welcome we felt in that low-ceilinged bungalow, Brodsky archly muttering “Horses, horses!” to the rumbling gallop of the espresso pot as it boiled on the stove.</p><p>Graduation and a Fulbright to translate Ingeborg Bachmann’s poems (ah, that list of poets he wrote down and its trajectory) took me to Vienna for the next two years, but never quite far from Brodsky. One day a package arrived with a copy of the latest <em>Vanity Fair,</em> which contained his splendid essay on Auden, “A Passion of Poets,” which he wanted me to deliver to a descendant of Prince Razumovsky (of Beethoven quartets fame), who had been kind to him on his landing there in June 1972. A couple of months later another item came, from a friend of mine and wrapped as a gift. Titled <em>J.B.–Debut,</em> it is a chapbook containing eight poems translated by Carl R. Proffer and published by Ardis, the Russian-language publishing house he helped found. The copyright page dates it as a limited edition published in 1973 in “twenty-six copies lettered A to Z and twenty copies numbered from 1 to 20, each signed by the author.” The warm wonder of it, as a gift from a friend who knew what Brodsky meant to me, could be matched only by the lifeblood inside, such as that of the lover doomed to exile at the end of “Sonnet”:</p><p>It was the same gift whenever a Brodsky poem appeared in a journal, magazine, or newspaper of the time. For they were not only poems, but news, missives from the outposts of Brodsky’s scattered transatlantic existence. This became particularly so in 1977, after Brodsky gained U.S. citizenship, and thus the security of a passport. Venice, Florence, Rome, Amsterdam, Paris, Mexico, Brazil, Sweden, London, San Francisco—one never knew where Brodsky was going to report from next, nor did it matter. Wherever he landed the outlook was always the same—the reason being, as he notes in his own translation of “North of Delphi,” “To man, every perspective empties / itself of his silhouette, echo, smell,” while “the pen creaking across the pad / in limitless silence is bravery in miniature.”</p><p>For many people, the stance of the globetrotting poet wore thin, seeming not so much a different orbit as a well-polished act, particularly the more his celebrity and fortune grew. Also troubling was his growing insistence on translating himself, or at best laying siege to the efforts of his faithful translators by elbowing his way into their versions with more “accurate” renderings, but versions that sometimes sounded tin-eared and clunky, their enjambment awkward and offbeat. This tension grew as Brodsky composed more and more original poems in English, many of them sounding like watered-down Auden, such as his “Bosnia Tune,” which argues, “While the statues disagree, / Cain’s version, history / for its fuel tends to buy / those who die.” But in the best of them “the wan flat voice” prevails, such as in “Törnfallet” from 1993, in which the poet imagines his widow circling a meadow in Sweden after his death, before concluding,</p><p>Or in the closing lines of “Reveille,” a poem published just a week after his passing:</p><p>Brodsky became a better poet in English, not only because his English attained near native proficiency (in the 15 years I knew him, I only once heard him search for a term he didn’t know, and that was “railroad tie”), but also because age and illness curbed his ambition, or better yet, his lack of inhibition in the grand Russian style. What did not lessen was the acuity of his vision, as well as his ability to embody what he also saw as the strength of American poetry, its “relentless nonstop sermon on human autonomy; the song of the atom, if you will, defying the chain reaction. Its general tone is that of resilience and fortitude, of exacting the full look at the worst and not blinking” (“An Immodest Proposal”).</p><p>Nostalgia is a feeling connected much more to places than to people. When asked whether he wanted to return to Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Brodsky would only say that, if he did, it would be because of a desire to see again an apartment or two, “places, not faces,” as he put it. Like many people, I miss visiting him and talking about poetry and life, but if I really think about it, the places are what I long to revisit—the apartment on Morton Street in Greenwich Village, or the open-beamed semidetached apartment at the back of Rawson House in South Hadley, Massachusetts, or drinks and dinner at what was then Woodbridge’s Inn up the street. But when revisited, they remain just places, emptied of Brodsky’s glowing presence and speech, the “Kisses! Kisses!” he offered everyone in parting. Or his quizzical advice, when I once despaired of finding a fit role in the world, “My dear Peter, don’t we all serve by default?” Or his spirited response, “Now, <em>this</em> is something! <em>This is something! </em>” when at his kitchen table in South Hadley, I showed him a photo of my toddler twin daughters and told him one bore the middle name of Josephine.</p><p>This all came home to me on a fresh spring day in 2015 when I found myself walking past 44 Morton Street for old times’ sake. The super was outside, hosing down the sidewalk, and when I looked in through the ground-floor window, I could see the whole apartment was open and under renovation. Since no one seemed to be around, I asked if I might walk down the alley to the back garden onto which Brodsky’s former living room–study opened. I figured that just seeing the trees and brickwork patio would be a comfort, but then I saw, standing outside, awaiting disposal, the refrigerator from the old apartment, its door removed and leaning against the wall, and inside its exposed cavity the abandoned travel carrier for Brodsky’s cat, Mississippi, a name he gave it because he thought cats liked sibilants far more than fricatives. All I could think of was what the poet had told me in “A Part of Speech,” right from the start:</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPermission required for reprinting, reproducing, or other uses.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</p>\",\"date\":\"2020-9-2\",\"link\":\"https://theamericanscholar.org/words-preserved-against-a-day-of-fear/#.X06wZMhKiUk\",\"discrp\":\"What Joseph Brodsky was able to set in motion: \\\"Not the limits of a meager idea, but the activity of thought itself.\\\"  .\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","{\"content\":\"<p>In February, in our family iMessage group, my brother asked our mother to indulge his craving for egg salad sandwiches. “That is so weird,” I replied. “I dreamt of mom’s egg salad <em>two days ago</em>.” It had been years since I had eaten it, but chewing in my dream, I realized the crunch of the celery that my mother added was the secret. “I had the same epiphany!!!” Dustin texted back. “The celery!!!”</p><p>He went on: Maybe this was the chemo he was doing, but Chinese and BBQ from spots we liked out of state were also appealing. He beat—by half a second—a message I was in the midst of sending about how I longed for food from those exact places. We exclaimed at the chances. Dustin joked that my two-month-old had “given us magical powers,” or that our family dog was controlling our minds. “THE LIMIT DOES NOT EXIST,” he said.</p><p>When my brother passed away at twenty-nine from complications of leukemia some weeks later, I livestreamed his funeral in Florida from under lockdown in France. The distance between us was imponderable, as great as it could ever be. We’d <em>both</em> wanted the egg salad. That the connection between us would be cut did not follow. Grief breaks your heart; also, it breaks your brain. While we keep the people we love in our hearts, it began to seem that Dustin was in my head more than anywhere else.</p><p>Mark Twain, though he did not go for spiritualism or immortality, would have agreed that siblings could tune into each other from opposite sides of the ocean. He believed, he once wrote,&nbsp; that a mind “still inhabiting the flesh” could reach another mind at great remove. There was an inciting incident in the spring of 1875 (before Twain’s red hair went gray), which he recollected as “the oddest thing that ever happened to me.”</p><p><span id=\\\"more-147129\\\"></span>The mail had just come at Twain’s home in Hartford, and he held a fat letter, still sealed. “Now I will do a miracle,” he drawled. He recognized the hand of someone from whom he said he hadn’t heard in eleven years. Even so, he knew without opening it that the letter contained a book idea. Their minds had been “in close and crystal-clear communication with each other across three thousand miles of mountain and desert on the morning of the 2nd of March.” Twain, in effect, had sat down to write to this very contact, on the same day, about this very same idea. Twain answered: “Dear Dan—Wonders never will cease.”</p><p>Dan De Quille was the alias of William Wright. In 1862, both men had started as staffers at the<em> Territorial Enterprise</em>&nbsp;in Virginia City, Nevada, and fast became a double-barreled force: the best writers at the hottest paper during the Silver Rush. De Quille was six years older than Samuel Clemens, who showed up, dusty, at twenty-six, as “Josh,” one of dozens of pseudonyms he tried on before becoming Twain.</p><p>The territory was given to gunplay, dustups, fire, pranks, and “high hope,” as Twain wrote in <em><a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/Roughing-Mark-Twain/dp/1423647726/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_1/141-1106037-7050462?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=1423647726&amp;pd_rd_r=56ee070a-e58a-46d3-af8b-bc261b7be07b&amp;pd_rd_w=gL5hy&amp;pd_rd_wg=QGjgY&amp;pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&amp;pf_rd_r=01K5E8E64KHRTXHWYTY6&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=01K5E8E64KHRTXHWYTY6\\\">Roughing It</a></em>, and its print culture was unruly, too. “Get your facts first, and … then you can distort ’em as much as you please” was his twenty-four-year-old editor in chief’s guidance. Twain, De Quille said, was averse to fact-heavy “‘cast-iron’ items,” but he was ace among the journalists there who played hell with objectivity and spun elaborate “sells,” from lampoons to hoaxes. (De Quille favored science hoaxes.) The boomtown’s denizens, Twain <a href=\\\"https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2018/01/09/impossibility-knowing-mark-twain/\\\">biographer</a> Gary Scharnhorst points out, had an appetite for <em>Harper’s</em>, <em>The Atlantic</em>, Dickens, and Shakespeare, as well as for the infotainment. It was said the <em>Enterprise</em>’s owners carried home thousand-dollar daily profits in water buckets.</p><p>De Quille and Twain “often cruised in company.” They shared a desk. They shared lodging—a double bed. “Mark and I agreed well as room-mates,” De Quille recalled. “Both wanted to read and smoke about the same length of time after getting into bed, and when one got hungry and got up to go down town for oysters the other also became hungry and turned out.” (Scharnhorst told me the theory the two were lovers has been “roundly scorned” by scholars, especially by Larry Berkove, the late authority on these journalist-humorists.) They enrolled in fencing club. “It is said to be highly amusing to witness a set-to between these two ‘roosters,’ they sometimes get so terribly in earnest,” reported the <em>Gold Hill Daily News</em>, which often trafficked in their antics. “Dan De Quille and Mark Twain are to be married shortly,” the paper kidded in April 1864. However, the next month, Twain hotfooted it to San Francisco. The bromance had lasted less than two years. “Nevertheless, their association was more intense and long-lasting than has been appreciated, for their sharing of ideas and stories must have been so extensive as to constitute a common pool,” Berkove reflected. He was unsurprised “that minds which were once so familiar and in tune with each other should continue to produce, even after the interval of many years, thoughts and compositions which bear the impress of the former partner.”</p><p>Ten years later, in October 1874, the motherlode was unearthed in Virginia City. The vein, which De Quille called the Big Bonanza, was the richest silver strike in American history and would pay out north of a billion dollars in bullion. De Quille was then the <em>Enterprise</em>’s mining expert (“with a love for the lode”) and a group of the mining magnates wished him to chronicle their Silverado. De Quille, a dipsomaniac who labored crazy hours for moderate moola, had other manuscripts on the stove, but he resolved to ask his former friend, the now-famous Twain, for advice on how to “turn clown.”</p><p>And, eureka! As De Quille was writing to him, Twain was reckoning that “the market was ready” for “The Story of the Comstock Lode, with all the strange &amp; romantic fortunes &amp; incidents connected with it,” and the person to pull off such a history, obviously, was “dandy quill.” Twain outlined the book he envisioned, hooked De Quille up with his publisher, and welcomed him to Hartford to “grind literature all day long in the same room,” blued by cigar smoke.</p><p>In 1878, Twain wrote about mental telegraphy in <em>A Tramp Abroad</em>. And before going to press, he blotted all of it out. “I feared the public would treat the thing as a joke and throw it aside,” he said, “whereas I was in earnest.” About a decade later: “I tried to creep in under shelter of an authority grave enough to protect the article from ridicule—the North American Review.” The chief, Lorettus Metcalf, insisted on Twain’s byline, but Twain understood that his forked tongue had saddled him with a believability problem, and people would not take him seriously, dammit. “So I pigeonholed the Ms., because I could not get it published anonymously.” Finally, for <em>Harper’s</em>, sixteen years after he received De Quille’s letter, in December 1891, Twain trotted out his surety that egg salad incidents like ours were not accidents.</p><p>“That is the puzzling part of it,” he wrote in “Mental telegraphy. A manuscript with a history.” “We are always talking about letters ‘crossing’ each other, for that is one of the very commonest accidents of this life. We call it ‘accident,’ but perhaps we misname it.” Elsewhere, Twain had proposed the “rapport between two minds” operated on “a finer and subtler form of electricity,” which inventors must harness for a thought-sending device, called the “phrenophone.” We’d be able to say, “‘Connect me with the brain of the chief of police at Peking.’”</p><p>A few years later, Twain returned to the subject of mental telegraphy in <em>Harper’s</em> with a fresh roll of examples. They were intricate. One day, for instance, he and his friend Joseph Twichell were going to visit Twichell’s daughter—to whom Twain was like an uncle—at her boarding school. As they journeyed, Twain told Twitchell of an encounter a while back: He was in Milan, when a soldier on leave approached him. Lieutenant H. explained that they’d met when he was a cadet and Twain and Twitchell had come to West Point. The soldier mentioned that he’d recently misplaced his letter of credit, and that an American couple with daughters—strangers—had lent him the money to settle his hotel bill. He was headed to repay them, and Twain went along. “I was introduced to the parents and the young ladies; then we separated, and I never saw him or them any m—.” Twain was interrupted as the trolley arrived at their stop. At Miss Porter’s School, lasses streamed by. A girl came up and shook Twichell’s hand—she was, she explained, a friend of his daughter. Then she turned to Twain: “And I wish to shake hands with you too, Mr. Clemens. You don’t remember me, but you were introduced to me in the arcade in Milan two years and a half ago by Lieutenant H.”</p><p>“I don’t exactly know what to do with Twain’s psychic claims,” Scharnhorst responded, when I asked him if Twain’s notion of mental telegraphy was another leg-pull, the same brand of jest he undertook in the West. “I don’t think it was.”</p><p>“But it’s basically coincidence,” Kevin Mac Donnell, a rare book dealer and Mark Twain scholar who owns the largest private collection of Twain material, including nine thousand first editions, letters, and manuscripts, told me by phone. “Twain dispatched fifty thousand letters in his lifetime, easily, and was a social butterfly, ever traveling. Of course his letters crossed and he ran into people in the street.”</p><p>Some of the <em>Bonanza</em> business as Twain narrated it does not prove out. A copy of the letter Twain sent in reply to De Quille’s letter survives. His dates are off. He tells De Quille his wife, Livy, was there when the mail came; in the magazine piece, Twain’s witness is another relative. Those are peccadillos. Less so the pretense that he “had not seen and had hardly thought of [De Quille] for eleven years” and did not even know if De Quille was alive. “That’s fudged,” said Mac Donnell. “He knew how to create buzz; how to quicken plot.” In March 1869, Twain wrote to De Quille that he intended to marry. Afterward, Twain sent a wedding announcement personalized with ancient in-jokes: “Old Dan, my abused roommate—{but who stole old Mrs. Fitch’s pies, nevertheless—&amp; Daggett’s wood.}”</p><p>Still, ben trovato exaggeration does not contradict sincerity. “As a mental exercise, as a literary device,” Mac Donnell said, “you can see how mental telegraphy works for Twain and connects to his overall open-mindedness.” Mac Donnell referred to <em>Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc</em>, Twain’s last novel. “He doesn’t question her visions,” Mac Donnell said.</p><p>In 1882, the Society for Psychical Research formed in London to investigate paranormal human experiences “without prejudice or prepossession.” The society did, however, want to prove thought transference, and that year one of its members coined the term “telepathy.” When Twain joined two years later, he told SPR’s cofounder that, ever since <em>Bonanza</em>, he had known the tête-à-têtes were real. When the notion to contact someone hit him, Twain confessed to feeling “like a mere amanuensis.” He assumed the other person had just cabled him. For the rest of his life, Twain continued to note the freakiness of telepathy.</p><p>Three years before his heart attack, in 1907, he wrote that “inventions, ideas, phrases, paragraphs, chapters, and even entire books” could all flow brain to brain. He said, resigned, “I often originate ideas in my mind but get almost all of them out of somebody else’s.” The inevitability of unintentional plagiarism bothered him. In November of 1907, Twain heard about a new story by George Bernard Shaw. It echoed in both style and substance one he’d composed seventeen years earlier—“hilarious and extravagant to the verge of impropriety,” and unread by anyone, because Livy would not let it print. Twain concluded that “Mr. Shaw must have gotten those incidents out of my head…”</p><p>Twain was serious, and not way off. He anticipated brain–computer interface, for one thing. Last fall, the system dubbed <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41895-7\\\">BrainNet</a>—a kind of phrenophone—allowed three people in different rooms to play a game of Tetris together with their minds. “I’m telling you about something so sci-fi,” <a href=\\\"https://www.chantelprat.com/\\\">Chantel Prat</a>, one of the neuroscientists who developed BrainNet, said on a call. BrainNet uses a machine to decode brain activity from a sender brain, an electroencephalography (EEG) cap to record that activity, and computer software to translate it for a receiver brain. “It’s very much like a microphone,” Prat explained. “This electrode sits on the scalp and picks up the electrical activity that’s happening inside the head. The signal extends outside the head. We can—we do—record outside the head what’s happening on the inside of it.” I asked how far brainwaves can travel: Were we talking centimeters? Inches, feet—football fields? Prat could not say. But it was not across mountains, deserts, or oceans.</p><p>“Most of our thoughts transmit at 40-200 hertz. They can’t go very far,” she said. “But the brain is like a radio. Brainwaves come in different frequencies; some happen at 2-7 hertz, and those lower frequencies have a farther range.” Researchers studying neurosemantics at Carnegie Mellon are able to decode words and even sentences in our brainwaves, but Prat wanted to emphasize that we can decode much more than we can encode. “When we put info in the brain,” she said, “it’s a lot like a sledgehammer coming down: We cannot put an idea in the brain. We can make somebody’s finger twitch.” She appreciated Mark Twain’s cast of mind, though.</p><p>In a socially distanced world, disconnected from Dustin, I’m left remembering his capacious imagination for human contact. People get into our heads. And when we know they are out there, thinking of us, us thinking of them, that signal is so clear. What Twain told De Quille is true: “human sympathies can stretch.”</p><p><em>Chantel Tattoli is a freelance journalist.

From his perch within the prime minister’s office, he advanced a policy of what he called “urban upgrading.” Instead of slum clearance and the creation of housing, Patterson argued for rehabilitating existing structures to make them more livable. Rather than seeking to expand employment through industrialization, he argued that the new policy should support the existing economy of street hawkers and petty traders. In lieu of the large, complex bureaucracies that tend to come with an expansion of the welfare state, the program focused on using community centers to deliver social services like health and child care.\\n</p><p>Patterson’s approach reflected a wider revolution in third world approaches to development, marking a shift from the heyday of modernization in the 1950s and ’60s to the basic-needs approach of the 1970s and ’80s, which emphasized decentralization and overcoming extreme poverty. Modernization programs had envisioned the complete transformation of society, but their benefits reached few postcolonial citizens. Though on its face, urban upgrading appeared less ambitious, it promised to bring meaningful improvements to a larger group of citizens, and it did so by empowering local communities.</p><p>Patterson, who is currently the John Cowles professor of sociology at Harvard University, reflects on this era in his latest book, <em>The Confounding Island: Jamaica and the Postcolonial Predicament</em>. An exploration of politics, economic development, and popular culture in the nearly 60 years since the island’s independence, the book seeks to understand what became of the promises of decolonization, including Manley’s socialism. For Patterson, the postcolonial predicament is largely characterized by failure—of specific programs like his urban upgrading project and of the wider efforts at social and economic transformation. Two of the book’s three sections are dedicated to assessing the disappointment of those unfulfilled aspirations. Yet it is not a melancholic work: In the ruins of postcolonial Jamaica, Patterson unearths a vibrant popular culture, centered in particular on dancehall music, that can provide new resources to address the postcolonial predicament.\\n</p><p><span>B</span>orn in 1940 in Westmoreland Parish in Jamaica, Patterson was the son of a police detective and a seamstress. Thanks in great part to his mother’s efforts and encouragement, he attended the prestigious Kingston College and was among the first cohort of undergraduates in the social sciences at the University College of the West Indies, then part of the University of London based in Kingston. His specialization in the social sciences rather than the humanities was not the path he had envisioned. When he arrived on campus in 1959, he was steeped in the emerging West Indian literature of the postwar period, attracted to the existentialism of Albert Camus, and committed to the study of history. He settled into economics and, later, sociology only after university officials rejected his application to major in history. The new nation needed social scientists more than it did humanists.</p><p>Despite some initial hesitation, Patterson embraced this calling, which soon brought him into contact with Manley, who was a decade and a half older but frequented the university. They remained in touch throughout the 1960s as Manley planned his entry into electoral politics and Patterson entered a sociology PhD program at the London School of Economics.</p><p>In fact, although they embarked on separate paths, their relationship grew stronger in these years, representing the marriage of politics and social science that characterized nation building in the decolonizing age. National independence was not just about the transfer of political power: It involved the formation of a national culture and state infrastructures, the nurturing of a homegrown intelligentsia, and the organization of new social data. Third world intellectuals were needed to furnish the historical and empirical analyses that would inform the policies of economic development and social transformation. Social scientists were at the center of this work.\\t\\t</p><p>Jamaica proved to be a key site for these entwined processes. University College received its independent charter and became the University of the West Indies in 1962, the year of Jamaican independence. By then, the faculty and students of the social sciences department had founded the West Indian Society for the Study of Social Issues, which became part of the New World Group, an organization of political economists dedicated to the study of the plantation and its afterlives in the Caribbean and around the world. The group’s journal, <em>New</em> <em>World Quarterly</em>, published from 1963 to 1972, not only covered the economies of the island states but also provided a venue for the region’s emerging literary cultures, one that always situated the Caribbean as part of a wider third world.\\n</p><p>Patterson played a key role in the society’s founding and participated in its research activities and discussions. Alongside fellow students Norman Girvan, who would join Manley’s government, and Walter Rodney, a Guyanese student who would soon become a radical historian of slavery and its legacies, Patterson was encouraged to pursue scholarly work and contribute to the nation’s development. After completing their PhDs in London, Patterson, Girvan, and Rodney returned to Jamaica to take up this calling.\\n</p><p>But the idea that the postcolonial university, housing scholars like these three, could play a supporting role in the country’s political and economic development was soon decisively challenged. In 1968 the government of Hugh Shearer barred Rodney from reentering Jamaica, prompting an eruption of student protest. The state’s repressive response made it difficult to sustain a vision of scholarship informing national transformation. Rodney took up a post at the University of Dar es Salaam, and a disillusioned Patterson departed for the United States.\\n</p><p>In 1970, Patterson arrived in America for a six-month sabbatical. Soon that sabbatical turned permanent: In the following year, he would receive a tenured faculty position at Harvard. While he settled into life as an academic in America, he continued to watch Jamaican politics closely, and his decision to go back as a special adviser to Manley’s government just two years after his move to the United States demonstrated how much the island continued to play a central role in his scholarly and political commitments. For him, the position of special adviser brought with it the opportunity to fulfill his generation’s calling. He could now apply the tools of the social scientist to the tasks of postcolonial transformation. As Patterson soon discovers, this calling came with new challenges: The independence of the intellectual proved difficult to square with popular politics. The short-term gratifications of charismatic action, a regular indulgence for a politician like Manley, did not agree with the intellectual Patterson’s constitution.\\t\\t</p><p>At the end of Manley’s second term in 1980, Patterson returned to full-time scholarship at Harvard. He never looked back. In the four decades since, he has published six highly regarded books on themes ranging from the sociology of slavery to the ordeal of racial integration in the United States. Though most of his work did not directly address his Jamaican experiences, the island’s history of slavery and emancipation and his involvement in postcolonial politics have continued to animate almost all of his thinking.\\n</p><p><span>T</span><em>he Confounding Island</em> brings us back to Jamaica and this period of Patterson’s political activism and subsequent skepticism and ambivalence. As a retrospective on decolonization and its aftermath, it works through the tensions that have gripped Jamaica since the 1960s and ’70s. The island now enjoys a vibrant democratic culture with free and fair elections and freedom of speech and of the press, but it is also one of the most violent societies in the world. Jamaica is a diverse multiracial country, yet it is marked by deep forms of economic hierarchy. It is a small island of just under 3 million people, but its musical forms and athletes have earned a dominant role in the global arena.\\t\\t\\t\\t</p><p>That Jamaica and its postcolonial quandaries are central to Patterson’s thinking can be seen in the fact that none of these themes are new to his work: In the earliest stage of his career, he combined fiction and sociology to capture the riddle of Jamaica’s postcolonial predicament. His first book, the 1964 novel <em>The Children of Sisyphus</em>, draws its title and themes from Camus’s <em>The Myth</em> <em>of Sisyphus</em>. It follows the residents of the Dungle, a Kingston slum, who are outcasts in a new nation struggling to get by. At the center of the narrative are members of a Rastafarian group, led by Brother Solomon, who eagerly await a ship to take them to Ethiopia, and Dinah, a prostitute who struggles against all odds to escape her social conditions. By the end of the novel, Brother Solomon reveals before killing himself that the anticipated ship was his fabrication, and Dinah finds herself firmly back at square one. Though their aspirations are thwarted, the Dungle’s residents remain determined to find a way out. They maintain the hope of a future transformation of their circumstances, no matter how impossible this may appear.\\n</p><p>Patterson’s second novel, 1967’s <em>An Absence of Ruins</em>, offers a biting portrait of the West Indian intellectual elite, the class that tasked itself with the making of the nation. The central character is Alexander Blackman, a young sociologist who returns to Jamaica after studying and working in London. The novel dramatizes the young man’s conflicted psyche: He is tormented by indecision, an unwillingness to commit in his intellectual, political, or personal life. Fearing the responsibility and judgment inherent in taking action, he ends up going back to London to live in hiding. Published just as Patterson was contemplating his own return from London, the novel uses Blackman’s internal crisis to explore the larger limits of the postcolonial intellectual’s preoccupation with securing identity to a stable past. Unable to accept the absence of such a past and trapped by the search for essence, Blackman finds himself incapable of seizing the opportunities and confronting the challenges posed by his present existence. History remains, for him and the nationalist intellectuals he represents, an impossible salvation.\\n</p><p>Beginning in the late ’60s, Patterson turned more and more to history—and its futilities—in his scholarly work as well, employing historical sociology to examine how transatlantic slavery had irrevocably destroyed the collective past. This would be the thesis of his dissertation at the London School of Economics, which appeared in 1967 as <em>The Sociology of Slavery</em>. A sweeping exploration of Jamaica from the 17th to the mid-19th century, the book argued that the dynamics of colonization and enslavement had produced a distinctively disintegrated social order. Eighteenth century Jamaica was on “the brink of the Hobbesian state of nature…loosely integrated; so much so that one hesitates to call it a society.” The masters and the enslaved constituted separate spheres, with the former consisting largely of absentee landlords who delegated their coercive authority to overseers. Under the violent plantation system, each enslaved person, Patterson argued, suffered from “a broken, trauma-ridden personality.”\\n</p><p>Written in the first decade of Jamaican independence, <em>The Sociology of</em> <em>Slavery</em> helped consolidate Patterson’s thinking about the limits of Jamaican nationalism. As he recalled in a 2013 interview with the Jamaican anthropologist and political theorist David Scott, “I was very much involved in a criticism of that love fest of the ‘Out of Many, One’ idea” (which referred to Jamaica’s national motto). The book contains two main elements from his career-long exploration of slavery. First, while a study of slavery in Jamaica, as its title suggests, it also presents sociology as a form of social criticism: Out of thick description comes generalizable argument. Second, it began to develop Patterson’s view of slavery as an entirely destructive process that leaves behind it only social and cultural discontinuity. Slavery was more than just an economic institution; it was a state of social death, too.\\n</p><p>In an early review, the Barbadian poet and historian Edward (later Kamau) Brathwaite critiqued both of these tendencies in Patterson’s work. His account of disorder and disintegration, Brathwaite argued, ignored how enslaved people generated stable social formations over time. One element of social regeneration that Patterson deemphasized, Brathwaite noted, was the African cultural traditions that were retained and expanded by enslaved people. Patterson’s thesis of discontinuity depended on “denying specific African survivals in Jamaica.” Through this denial, Brathwaite said, Patterson elevated slavery’s disintegrative effects into a general and unchanging condition in the New World.\\n</p><p>Brathwaite’s 1971 <em>The Development of Creole Society in Jamaica, 1770–1820 </em>countered this picture by tracing the creative reinvention of European and African traditions, which produced a majority Afro-Creole folk culture in the Black Atlantic. Without recognizing this social and cultural creativity, <em>The Sociology of Slavery</em> struggles, in Brathwaite’s view, to explain a surprising feature of Jamaican slave society—that it had given rise to the most slave revolts in the Americas. Indeed, Patterson acknowledges this limit near the end of his book. “Sociological explanation can only partly explain the persistence of this spirit of rebellion,” he writes.\\n</p><p><span>A</span>s he did earlier, Patterson explored this spirit of rebellion in a novel before turning to the questions of emancipation and freedom in a sociological work. His last novel to date, <em>Die the Long Day</em> (1972), offers an early example of what we now call the neo-slave narrative. The novel’s protagonist is Quasheba, a name that refers to the Jamaican version of Sambo, a feminine figure associated with submission and docility. Patterson turns this figure on its head, making her an agent of resistance. Seeking to protect her daughter, Polly, from the advances of a syphilitic master, Quasheba becomes a rebel, asserting, “Me is human too and is only one time they can kill me.”\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t</p><p>By conceiving the enslaved Jamaican as a character who announces a universal language of humanity, Patterson presents the Caribbean archipelago as the exemplary space of modernity. In this approach, he followed the Trinidadian Marxist C.L.R. James, who mentored Patterson during his London sojourn. In the final pages of the second edition of <em>The</em> <em>Black Jacobins</em>, James’s classic history of the Haitian Revolution, he argues that the twin institutions of “the sugar plantation and Negro slavery…imposed…an original pattern” in the West Indies. Neither European nor African, both outside the “American main” and “not native in any conceivable sense of that word,” the West Indies’ culture and politics proved to be “sui generis, with no parallel anywhere else.” As a result, West Indians “from the very start lived a life that was in its essence a modern life.”\\n</p><p>This powerful vision of Caribbean modernity percolates throughout Patterson’s work. The small islands occasioned the grand questions of slavery and freedom, of self-making in the wake of violent deracination—questions for every people on every continent in the modern world. And even after Patterson had turned from Jamaica to a wider canvas, he drew his inspiration from the modernist landscape of the Caribbean. His career-defining books, <em>Slavery and Social Death</em> and <em>Freedom in</em> <em>the Making of Western Culture</em>, which spanned the globe and the ancient and modern eras, carried the figure of Quasheba onto the stage of historical sociology.\\n</p><p><span>F</span>irst published in 1982, <em>Slavery and</em> <em>Social Death</em> introduced Patterson’s now-canonical definition of slavery as “the permanent, violent domination of natally alienated and generally dishonored persons.” Drawing on sources from 66 slave societies, ranging from ancient China to the New World, he moved from generalizing from one island’s experience to documenting his arguments on a global scale. He dispensed with the legal categorization of enslaved people as property and the economic dimension of their exploitation, taking up slavery as primarily a social and political institution. What Patterson called the “social death” of the enslaved emerged from the fact that slavery was often a “conditional commutation” of a death sentence that denied them any connection to their ancestors and descendants. The enslaved person was “a genealogical isolate.” As the example of Quasheba makes clear, social death did not mean she was without social relations; the problem was that they “were never recognized as legitimate and binding.” As a result, enslaved people were forced to become liminal figures, always dependent on their masters to mediate their relations with the wider social world.\\n</p><p>Critics like the historian Vincent Brown have argued that invocations of social death obscure the rich practices through which enslaved people sought to preserve their ancestral ties. The concept of social death, Brown insisted, is an ideal type that “provides a neat cultural logic” but tends to obscure the specific experiences of slavery and the political struggles that transformed the institution. Patterson would not necessarily disagree: For him, sociology requires a necessary “schematism” that operates like “the essential heavy plow that must first clear the ground, turn the rough soil, and demarcate the boundaries.” He did not mean for this schematism to displace historical specificity but instead to illuminate recurring structures of domination. Yet as the concept of social death was taken up in American slavery studies, it increasingly came to name the singular experience of racialized chattel slavery. Patterson resisted this exceptionalism, rejecting the thesis that chattel slavery in the United States was a “peculiar institution.”\\n</p><p>No matter the schematism, <em>Slavery and Social Death</em> certainly cleared important ground. It also helped reveal the intertwined roots of slavery and freedom. “The idea of freedom,” Patterson writes, “is born, not in the consciousness of the master, but in the reality of the slave’s condition.” This would be the thesis of <em>Freedom in the Making of Western Culture. </em>Published in 1991, just as the self-declared free world was congratulating itself on a hard-fought victory against its communist foe, the book examines the birth of freedom as a concept and value in the Western world. Freedom, Patterson argues, is a quintessentially Western ideal. But despite this, his story of Western freedom situated its birth in the degradation and domination of slavery. If those heralding the West’s triumph in the Cold War assumed that the history of Western freedom somehow qualified it for global supremacy, they misunderstood the paradoxical conditions that gave rise to this ideal. An arresting passage signals the darker story Patterson wanted to tell:\\n</p><p>Originally, the problem I had set out to explore was the sociohistorical significance of that taken-for-granted tradition of slavery in the West. Armed with the weapons of the historical sociologist, I had gone in a search of a man-killing wolf called slavery; to my dismay I kept finding the tracks of a lamb called freedom. A lamb that stared back at me, on our first furtive encounters in the foothills of the Western past, with strange, uninnocent eyes. Was I to believe that slavery was a lamb in wolf’s clothing? Not with my past. And so I changed my quarry. Finding the sociohistorical roots of freedom, understanding its nature in time and context, became my goal.</p><p>To search for freedom’s sociohistorical roots in slavery, Patterson begins with ancient Greece—the first place the institution of slavery became a constitutive feature of the social order. In Athens, between the end of the seventh century and the early fourth century bce, the expansion of slavery created the sociological conditions in which freedom was idealized and institutionalized. This period saw a dramatic rise in the size and proportion of the enslaved population, gradually becoming a structurally significant feature of Athenian society and yet also enabling its flowering as Europe’s first democracy. On the foundations of slavery came the formation of classical and modern notions of liberty.\\n</p><p>The entwined origins of freedom and slavery have, Patterson argues, produced three distinct conceptions of freedom that the classical and modern worlds accepted. First, personal liberty—the absence of domination—appeared among those who lived in constant “terror of enslavement.” Because women were the most likely to be captured as slaves or to witness the condition of slavery in the home, Patterson argues, they were the progenitors of this negative ideal. Second, as slavery became more institutionalized, civic freedom appeared as a strategy of incorporating the unenslaved masses into a collective whole, a citizenry. The value of democratic citizenship came into view in juxtaposition to the nonnative slave. As a result, the high point of Athenian democracy coincided with the tightening of the boundaries of inclusion. Finally, imperial expansion, fueled in part by slavery, sanctified this ideal of sovereignty. Sovereign autonomy had been limited to the elite, but now it could be claimed as a democratic principle, a right of all citizens within a society at the expense of those outside it.\\n</p><p><span>A</span> striking feature of Patterson’s <em>Freedom in the Making of Western</em> <em>Culture</em> is that his indictment of freedom as an ideal “founded…upon a rock of human virtue but upon the degraded time fill of man’s vilest inhumanity to man” is enunciated not from the position of an external critic but from the point of view of an insider, someone who strongly identifies with what he calls “our civilization’s preeminent ideal.” The ease with which Patterson claims Western civilization for himself and yet limns its paradoxes is itself a marker of the Caribbean’s sui generis modernity, one born from Atlantic slavery.\\n</p><p>For Patterson, the Caribbean and the African diaspora in the Americas more broadly embody both the promise and the perils of modern freedom. The consequences of slavery’s disintegrative power left Black people in the Americas uniquely unburdened by the past and able to manifest the freedom of self-making. While Black nationalists have sought to remedy this absence of a past, suturing the wounds of deracination through a search for common origins, Patterson views it as a liberating condition. As he put it in a 1972 essay, Black people in the Americas should\\n</p><p>abandon their search for a past [and] recognize that they lack all claim to a distinctive cultural heritage…[thus] accepting the epic challenge of their reality. Black Americans can be the first group in the history of mankind who transcend the confines and grip of a cultural heritage, and in so doing, they can become the most truly modern of all peoples—a people who feel no need for a nation, a past, or a particularistic culture.</p><p>This is a mighty task to place on a single group, especially one subjected to the modern world’s original sin of chattel slavery, and some readers have imputed a conservatism to Patterson’s rejection of Black particularism and cultural nationalism. Yet nothing signals the revolutionary like the desire to be freed from the shackles of the past, and one might note that there is in Patterson’s declaration of “a future that has no past” a bold and radical vision of the Black diaspora as a vanguard, a universal class that ushers in a “new New World.”\\n</p><p><span>F</span>or many intellectuals and radicals born in countries rapidly breaking their imperial chains, the era of decolonization promised precisely this: to make the world anew. As Frantz Fanon, whom Patterson praised in an essay subtitled “My Hope and Hero,” proclaimed, “We must turn over a new leaf…work out new concepts, and try to set afoot a new man.” The postcolonial world birthed in the mid-20th century has fallen far short of that aspiration. But as Patterson witnessed, decolonization heralded a universalization of the Western ideal of freedom, especially in its democratic permutation. If the end of empire achieved nothing else, it forever delegitimized the view that democratic self-rule was the exclusive purview of the West. Since then, democracy has become the world’s lingua franca for political legitimacy. Yet the triumph of democracy remains ambiguous, not only because it has yet to become universal but also because where democracy and collective freedom have been institutionalized, a yawning gap between our expectations and our experiences of this ideal remains.\\n</p><p>This gap is at the heart of Patterson’s account of the postcolonial predicament in <em>The Confounding Island</em>. The book is a homecoming in two senses: Not only does it return to the place of his birth and intellectual formation; it also allows him to revisit the twinned projects of nation building and social scientific inquiry. This time, though, the postcolonial social scientist does not play adviser to the democratic prince. Instead, he arrives at the scene of nationalism’s failure in order to excavate and interpret its ruins. Seeking to develop a framework that can capture the processes from which the postcolonial predicament emerged—and not just by reference to a Euro-American yardstick—Patterson has created a layered account of these ruins, one that begins with the historical forces of colonialism and plantation slavery and works its way to the contradictions of political leadership embodied in the figure of Manley. As in his earlier work, Patterson’s attention to his particular subject does not lead him to abandon the universal themes that have marked his career. Instead, he uses the “confounding island” as the site from which to understand the world.\\n</p><p>His impulse to do so has some justification. For one thing, the postcolonial predicament characterizes most of the world: At the height of imperialism, over 80 percent of the planet’s land was subject to European conquest and control. Colonial rule and decolonization were thus a nearly universal experience. For another, the features that make Jamaica a confounding island, he insists, also reveal the wider dilemmas of modern democratic politics. Patterson’s goal is to frame and pose the particulars of Jamaica to disclose a set of universals.\\n</p><p>The roots of Jamaica’s postcolonial democracy, like the origins of freedom, are, Patterson argues, in slavery and colonization. Drawing on his work in <em>The Sociology of Slavery</em>, he begins with a question: Why did the various Caribbean societies where extractive plantations prevailed have different economic and political outcomes? Jamaica and Barbados, for example, have had divergent trajectories, such that by 2000, Barbados had a real per capita GDP of $22,694, compared with Jamaica’s $5,819. While some point to the policy choices of Manley’s socialist government, Patterson has a different answer: This divergence has its roots in colonialism. Though both were plantation economies, a greater planter presence and more women than men among the enslaved in Barbados created circumstances for stability and gradual social integration. Returning to his disagreement with Brathwaite, Patterson now argues that the conditions for creolization—the development of a distinctive New World society—existed there but remained minimal in Jamaica during colonization.\\n</p><p>The two islands’ divergence only widened, Patterson argues, after slavery’s abolition. In 1866, just a year after the Morant Bay Rebellion, in which Black and brown Jamaicans demanded equal political and economic rights, the white-dominated House of Assembly abolished itself. The planter class decided to forgo self-rule rather than share political power with former slaves. Anxious that they might be enslaved to a Black majority, the Jamaican elite abdicated a key element of their sovereign freedom. In Barbados, on the other hand, a more stable planter class was politically secure enough to leave representative institutions intact.\\n</p><p>The persistence of local parliamentary institutions and the social integration of creolization in Barbadian culture did not mean that Black Barbadians experienced racial equality or greater freedom. The franchise, for instance, was limited to property owners. Moreover, the plantation system survived emancipation in Barbados relatively intact, whereas Jamaican peasants were able to enjoy greater personal freedom as a result of the struggles to protect peasants and to enable small-scale farming. Yet even if these forms of hierarchy and exploitation persisted in Barbados, Patterson argues that the institutions of representative government and the rule of law established post-emancipation bequeathed to its citizens a stronger and more independent state, one with the institutional capacity to create high levels of literacy and a per capita GDP that was in 1966, the year of Barbadian independence, 57&nbsp;percent higher than Jamaica’s when it gained independence in 1962.\\n</p><p><span>W</span>hile Jamaica has lagged Barbados on economic indicators since decolonization, it has successfully institutionalized a parliamentary democracy. Patterson moves from the legacy of the colonial past to the postcolonial present in order to assess the experience of democracy there. On every indicator, from free and fair elections to robust protections for freedom of the press, Jamaica ranks highly. Yet as Patterson notes, democratization has coincided with extreme levels of violence. Jamaica’s murder rate of 58 per 100,000 people in 2005 “made it the most homicidal nation in the world.” While we tend to think the ballot replaces the bullet, Patterson argues that in this instance the bullet followed the ballot.\\n</p><p>This uptick in violence coincided with postcolonial state building and the consolidation of the country’s two main political parties, the Jamaica Labor Party and the People’s National Party, in the early 1940s. The proliferation of guns due to the global trade in illicit drugs not only centered on criminal activities; it also permeated partisan politics. The fact that jobs, houses, and other rewards were distributed and controlled by the victors of an election added to the stakes of party affiliation. For politicians, the dispensation of patronage proved a powerful means of securing electoral support, and thus violence erupted around it. After all, for members of the various constituencies, ensuring that their candidate won was tied very directly to the material conditions of their lives. Under these circumstances, violence began to supplement the electoral process.\\n</p><p>Patronage, however, is not the only way that “the democratic process both enables and is enabled by violence,” Patterson argues. The forms of mobilization that large-scale democracies require tend to calcify political identities and exacerbate conflict. Jamaican politics is not marked by ethnic conflict—but even where racial and ethnic identities are not electorally salient, Patterson demonstrates how parties and elections inspire a solidarity and loyalty that ultimately entrench divisions and violence within a society. He calls this the “tribalism” of democracy.\\n</p><p>It is tempting to view violence and tribalism as yet another sign of democracy’s imperfect realization in the countries that decolonized after World War II. But as Patterson notes, these are features of democracy around the world. One need look no further than the electoral rise of authoritarian populism across the North Atlantic to see that even where democratic politics is most established, it is not immune to the recurring challenges of polarization, violence, and nativism. The sociological conditions of democracy in Jamaica are indeed distinct from those in Europe and the United States. But precisely by examining democracy in a variety of contexts, we can better grasp the features that have remained relatively submerged in North Atlantic countries.\\n</p><p><span>E</span>lectoral mobilization is only one of modern democracy’s paradoxes. Patterson examines another set of challenges through an analysis of his time in Manley’s government. The policy of urban upgrading that Patterson pioneered in the Southside area of Kingston yielded mixed results. It successfully provided social services through community centers that offered child care, services for elders, and a health clinic, and the project staffers were able to institute a truce among rival gangs in the area. But one of its central goals, enticing landlords to rehabilitate their properties through government-backed loans, was largely unsuccessful. Even as an expansive and egalitarian state project sought to meet the basic needs of citizens, those most in need of housing rehabilitation—the tenants of absentee landlords—were excluded from its benefits. Many of the public investments ended up being captured by better-off members of the community.\\n</p><p>For Patterson, the unintended consequences of his urban programs offer a small window into a central conundrum faced by democratic states. For much of the history of Western political thought, democracy was feared as the rule of the poor multitudes. The advocates of decolonization half a century ago seized on this view, celebrating the self-rule of the oppressed masses. But as contemporary conditions around the world indicate, without measures to check economic inequality, democratic institutions can be captured by political and economic elites.\\n</p><p>Yet Patterson argues that even as the poor are structurally excluded from meaningfully exercising rule, democratic politics, especially elections, tend to reward the theater of populist overtures. During his time as special adviser, Patterson watched in dismay as elected officials in Jamaica either undermined or dismissed his urban upgrading program, favoring instead a populist rhetoric backed up by the occasional construction of a housing project. Sweeping promises of new housing—as well as the patronage available from controlling access to the units that were built—became the preferred option for political elites seeking to ensure their reelection. While elite responsiveness to constituencies is seen as the quintessential feature of democratic politics, Patterson argues that there is an incongruity between meeting “the needs of the poor” and “maintaining the power of a political leader” that only widens the more democratic a society is.\\n</p><p>For Patterson, Manley’s political career embodies these conundrums of democratic leadership, and in the last chapter he reckons with Manley’s government and its legacies. Patterson tried to write about Manley before this, but as Patterson notes, he had experienced a mental block until he was asked to write a foreword for Rachel Manley’s memoir of her father. Even in <em>The Confounding Island,</em> he restricts his discussion to a pained and relatively brief treatment that attests to his continued difficulties when assessing his longtime friend, the political leader whose call he felt compelled to answer. But with many years’ distance, he is able to provide an intimate picture here of Manley’s rise and fall.\\n</p><p><span>F</span>or Patterson, Manley was an enigmatic figure, one riven by contradictions. Born into the Creole elite—his father, Norman Manley, was Jamaica’s first premier, and his British-born mother, Edna Manley, was a sculptor—Michael Manley became a man of the people. Though he was animated by the intellectual and personal challenge of democratic politics, he disdained its retail aspects and remained distant from his constituents, who were nonetheless enchanted by his charisma. Incorruptible in public life, Patterson writes, Manley was “unscrupulous and dishonest in his intimate relations.” In Patterson’s view, these characteristics facilitated the ambition and daring with which Manley embarked on Jamaica’s project of democratic socialism, but they also fueled the vacillation and indecision that marked his first two terms as prime minister.\\n</p><p>Manley came to power under the slogan “Better must come,” a promise to ameliorate the social and economic conditions of the majority of Jamaicans. His plans to redistribute land, expand social services, democratize the workplace, and harness a greater share of the profits from the bauxite industry were couched in an international commitment to third world politics. His close relationship with Fidel Castro and his advocacy for the New International Economic Order—the third world’s demand for an egalitarian global economy—infuriated the United States, which sought to isolate Cuba and undermine radical politics across the Americas.\\n</p><p>Despite Manley’s bold domestic and global vision, he proved unable to hold together the leftists and moderates in his party. Nor was he prepared to deal with the capital flight that followed his announcement of democratic socialism and the emigration of the middle and professional classes in the wake of political violence and a shrinking economy. As was the case for many third world states in the 1970s, the oil crisis exacerbated Jamaica’s economic woes and sank the island further into debt. In 1977, with the economy in free fall, Manley accepted a structural adjustment program from the International Monetary Fund, deciding against an alternative plan put forward by his advisers.\\n</p><p>While Manley’s democratic socialism ended tragically, his government, for Patterson, was not a complete failure. In the first five years it increased investment in education and health care, cut infant mortality rates, expanded labor’s share of income, and shielded peasant producers from the competition of imported food. Patterson notes that “the flight of the traditional white, Asian, and light-skinned elite unlocked their stranglehold of centuries on the nation’s wealth and opened entrepreneurial doors for the black businesspeople who stayed.”\\n</p><p>Manley’s commitment to the working and popular classes helped unleash the “Afro-Jamaican culture of the masses.” As in the United States, the 1970s were the era of Black power in the Caribbean, which challenged the Creole elite and colonial cultures that dominated the region. Manley’s Jamaica would see the rise of reggae and later dancehall, musical genres that embody a democratized Jamaican culture and that now resonate globally.\\n</p><p><span>T</span>he innovation and creativity of Jamaican popular culture, according to Patterson, offer us insight into a different path forward for postcolonial societies. In sharp contrast to an elite culture in which the Jamaican middle class imitates the consumptive practices and habits of its global counterparts, reggae and dancehall embrace the local and the vernacular. As Patterson writes, dancehall especially celebrated “the blackest, folksiest, and most lumpenproletarian aspects of Jamaican culture.”\\n</p><p>Reggae’s and dancehall’s rejection of the Jamaican middle class reinforces his early critique of postcolonial nationalism, which empowered a nationalist bourgeoisie and left the country’s working classes behind. It also returns him to the characters in <em>The</em> <em>Children</em> <em>of Sisyphus</em>. The novel anticipated, according to David Scott, the soundscape of the reggae generation. In the poetics and music of the Dungle, Patterson suggests, new cultural as well as political possibilities reside. He finds fault with the violence, misogyny, and homophobia of dancehall, but he sees it as a profound commentary on the postcolonial predicament as well. Dancehall, Patterson writes, “is a performative venue that incites the most aural and carnal assault on the traditional inequities of class, color, language, gender, and social mores in Jamaican society.” Jamaican popular culture may not offer a straightforward alternative blueprint for the island, he concedes, but it embodies the modern condition.\\n</p><p>For Patterson, dancehall dramatizes the rootlessness and alienation of modernity. The cacophonous orality of dancehall is not meant to be apprehended and made sense of by the ear; instead, it is absorbed by the body. He argues that this makes dancehall an immanently global form. Rooted in the particularities of the Jamaican condition—what Patterson calls an “aggressive localism”—dancehall nonetheless contains a universal appeal: Its sounds can be heard in nightclubs around the world, it has influenced American hip-hop, and it has spurred local iterations from Japan to South Africa. Dancehall thus embodies Patterson’s method of disclosing the universal in and through Jamaica’s postcolonial predicament.\\n</p><p>Popular culture cannot resolve the dilemmas of postcolonial democracy. Nor does it complete the unfinished work of social and economic transformation. But in dancehall’s rejection of dependency and submission, in its challenge to middle-class mimicry, and in its creative joining of the local and the global, Patterson finds a Jamaica striving toward its and its neighbors’ historic role: to be a truly modern people, unburdened by the past and embarking on an adventure of democratic self-creation. Through it, Patterson reminds us, the challenge of building a “future that has no past” might yet be realized.\\n\\t</p><p><img src=\\\"//cdn.revcontent.com/assets/img/rc-logo.png\\\"></p><p>The content you see here is paid for by the advertiser or content provider whose link you click on, and is recommended to you by Revcontent.

Moore died in 1958 the obituary notices mourned the death of a “great philosopher”. But now, some sixty years after his death and more than a century since many of his main publications, his life and work belong to the history of philosophy, and some doubt that he left any long-term contributions to philosophical understanding and debate (in April, Ray Monk wrote a piece in <em>Prospect</em> asking “why did GE Moore disappear from history?”). So, were the obituaries right?</p><p>Moore (who much disliked his forenames “George Edward”, and was always known as plain “Moore”) was born in Upper Norwood (south-east London) in 1873. His parents were Baptists, and there was a strong religious atmosphere at home which prompted him, as a young teenager, to feel that it was his duty to engage in evangelical activity despite a deep reluctance to do so. But a couple of years later Moore shed his religious beliefs and pronounced himself a “complete Agnostic”. </p><p>He was educated at Dulwich College, where he studied Latin and Greek, and in 1892 he won a scholarship to study Classics at Trinity College, Cambridge. Here his life changed: during his first year at Cambridge, his new friends and acquaintances introduced him to philosophical discussion and debate, and Moore was sufficiently excited and engaged by these discussions to add philosophy to his studies for the next two years. Bertrand Russell later described him: “In my third year I met G. E. Moore, who was then a freshman, and for some years he fulfilled my ideal of genius. He was in those days beautiful and slim, with a look almost of inspiration as deeply passionate as Spinoza’s”. Moore was invited to join the Apostles, a group of students and young academics devoted to the discussion of short philosophical papers, typically couched in a provocative idiom – Moore’s papers have titles such as “Are we hypocrites?” and “What is it to be wicked?”. After a few years, Moore became the leading figure in this group, some of whose younger members (many of whom would go on to participate in the Bloomsbury Set, such as Leonard Woolf, Thoby Stephen, Lytton Strachey, Clive Bell and John Maynard Keynes) became close friends. </p><p>In 1896 Moore graduated from Cambridge with a first class degree in Moral Sciences and decided to pursue an academic career as a philosopher. At this time there was no established programme in Britain (unlike in Germany) for postgraduate research studies leading to the conferral of a doctorate. Moore did however have the opportunity to try for a six year “Prize” fellowship (what we would now call a junior research fellowship) at Trinity College, which would, in principle, put him in a position to embark upon an academic career. So in 1897, just a year after graduation, Moore submitted a dissertation on “The Metaphysical Basis of Ethics”. This is a confusing piece of work in which Moore sometimes seems to be using F. H. Bradley’s Absolute Idealism to criticize Kant’s Transcendental Idealism.Moore’s main target is Kant’s claim that the requirements of morality are based on the structure of practical reasoning. Moore argues that it is only when reasons for action aim to promote the good that the actions thus justified are moral acts, and that the good itself, the true basis of morality, cannot be defined in terms of reason. Moore was not awarded a Prize Fellowship on the basis of this dissertation, so he spent the next year revising it and generalizing his criticism of Kant’s transcendental idealism. Moore now argues that just as the moral law is not based on practical reason, <em>a priori</em> truths concerning the basic structure of the world are not based on theoretical reason. According to Moore, Kant’s work is vitiated by being “merely psychological” in that his “Copernican Revolution” amounts to the claim that it is because our minds are so constituted that we cannot but think in terms of these supposed <em>a priori</em> truths that we take them to be true – which, Moore argues, is no good reason to conclude that they are in fact true. A further feature of this revised dissertation is that Moore now adds F. H. Bradley to his targets, on the grounds that Bradley’s claim that the meanings of words are “parts of the content” of a speaker’s ideas amounts to a similar psychologism concerning meanings, which Moore opposes by affirming a full-blooded realism concerning the “concepts” which are the meanings of our words.</p><p>Moore’s revised dissertation was successful, and he was awarded a Prize Fellowship at Trinity which lasted from 1898 until 1904. He used these years to convert his dissertations into publications. The first of these was the paper “The Nature of Judgment” (1899) in which he presented his criticisms of Bradley’s theory of ideas and then laid out a new realist metaphysics of concepts and propositions. Central to this position was a sharp distinction between the “content” of thought, which is psychological, and its non-psychological “object”, such as a concept or proposition. In other papers Moore applied this distinction to other mental acts, arguing that even in the visual perception of a colour such as blue, the blue is itself no part of the content of experience; instead the experience is a “diaphanous” emptiness which presents to us the colour blue as its object, something external to the experience. In these papers Moore presents a full-blooded realist account of the world and our relationship to it, radically opposed to the complex idealist positions advanced by established philosophers such as F. H. Bradley. Many of Moore’s arguments are altogether too brisk to do justice to the positions he opposed, but to his young contemporaries Moore’s new realist approach seemed to provide a liberation from the confusing fog of idealist philosophy. Russell, in particular, took his lead at this time from Moore – writing that “On fundamental questions of philosophy, my position, in all its chief features, is derived from G. E. Moore”. Indeed in his 1958 obituary notice for Moore, Russell still emphasized the importance of Moore’s early philosophy: “It was towards the end of 1898 that Moore and I rebelled against both Kant and Hegel. Moore led the way, but I followed closely in his footsteps. I think that the first published account of the new philosophy was Moore’s article in <em>Mind</em> on ‘The Nature of Judgment’ … I still think that this article gave conclusive proof of philosophical genius”.</p><p>Despite Russell’s comments, the most significant work Moore completed during this period was <em>Principia Ethica</em> (1903), his contribution to ethical theory. Moore here develops his early criticisms of Kant by arguing that just as rationalist definitions of the good are mistaken, so too are “naturalistic” definitions. These include definitions of the good in terms of pleasure, which, he claims, contain a fallacy (“the naturalistic fallacy”), whereby a substantive ethical principle – such as the claim that pleasure is the fundamental good – is treated as if it were true by definition. In fact, one can easily see that even if it is true, it is a contestable claim whose truth is an “open question”. Whether there really is a fallacy here is disputable – much depends on what a definition involves – but there is no doubt that Moore did here open up an important debate in ethical theory. As well as claiming that the good is indefinable, Moore also claimed that it is not a natural property at all. His reasoning here was that something’s goodness, (e.g. the goodness of a kind act), is not a simple natural property of the act which by itself makes the act good; instead its goodness is a feature which depends upon other properties of the thing without being definable in terms of them. This claim is widely accepted, but just what this non-specific dependence (or “supervenience”, as it is often now called) amounts to remains a matter of active debate. Putting these two points together, therefore, it is apparent that Moore provided a fresh start to debates concerning the nature of ethical concepts which continue today under the name “metaethics”. Moore’s ideas also proved attractive to the Bloomsbury Set. What appealed to them in his <em>Principia Ethica</em> was not the abstract discussion of the indefinability of good, but rather his account of the greatest goods – “the pleasures of human intercourse and the enjoyment of beautiful objects”. He held that “it is only for the sake of these things … that any one can be justified in performing any public or private duty”. As Keynes remarked later, this judgement is ignorant and elitist – it ignores the mundane values that are central to the demands of justice. But what one can say in defence of the Set’s enthusiasm for it (as expressed, for example, by Clive Bell in <em>Civilisation</em>) is that Moore’s “ideal” (as he himself called it) is an important personal ideal, and as such his articulation of it helped to contribute both to the Bloomsbury Set’s self-confidence and to the broader recognition of the value of art in British culture.</p><p>Moore’s prize fellowship came to an end in 1904, but in 1911 he was appointed to a lectureship at Cambridge (on a salary of £50), and thus began his career at the University, where he was appointed Professor of Philosophy in 1925, and where he remained until his retirement in 1939. Throughout this period Moore lectured three times a week, generally on topics in “metaphysics” (which Moore took to be any area of philosophy except ethics and aesthetics), writing new lectures each year and inviting students to his house every week to discuss questions that came up in his lectures. There were just four established positions in Philosophy at Cambridge (two professors and two lecturers), so the demands for teaching were heavy, and throughout his career Moore never enjoyed a period of research leave. Indeed, he made things more difficult for himself in 1921 by taking on the role of Editor at <em>Mind</em>, the main British philosophy journal, a position he held until 1947. During these years Moore became a central figure in British philosophy. His beneficial influence can be seen, for instance, in the fact that he persuaded Victor Gollanz to publish A. J. Ayer’s famous positivist manifesto <em>Language, Truth and Logic </em>in 1936 even though Moore disagreed with central aspects of Ayer’s position. Moore’s influence was often informal, almost Socratic. Gilbert Ryle, one of the next generation of philosophers, described Moore’s contribution to meetings of philosophers: </p><p>And Rush Rhees,\\nwho studied with Moore and Ludwig Wittgenstein at Cambridge in the 1930s,\\ndescribed Moore as a teacher: </p><p>But what of the\\nintellectual content of Moore’s writings during this period? Two themes\\npredominate – philosophical analysis and common sense – which come together in\\nthe conception of the discipline as a kind of philosophical analysis of common\\nsense. Right from the start, Moore had emphasized the importance of analysis; thus\\nin <em>Principia Ethica</em> Moore holds that it is because <em>good</em> is not analysable into simpler concepts that it is\\nindefinable. The conception of analysis in play here is limited, however, and\\nthe whole topic was radically transformed over the next few years as Russell\\ndeveloped new techniques of logical analysis which led him in 1914 to advocate\\nhis new “logical-analytic method in philosophy”. </p><p>Moore, though no\\ngreat innovator in logical theory himself, was one of the first philosophers to\\nappreciate the significance of Russell’s writings in logic, stating later that “I\\ncertainly have been more influenced by him than by any other single philosopher”.\\nBut for Moore, philosophical analysis was never just logical analysis; the way\\nhe put it was that it was a project of “identifying the principal or ultimate\\nsubject” of judgement, especially demonstrative judgements of perception, such\\nas in his famous example: “This is a hand”. While much of Moore’s discussion of\\nthese judgements now seems misconceived, he often deploys an acute sensitivity\\nto complexities and implications of ordinary language which had been neglected\\nby logicians such as Russell. So while Moore was not an “ordinary language\\nphilosopher” in the manner of J. L. Austin, he did begin the task of elucidating\\nthe complex implications of ordinary language and its use – a task of enduring importance\\nin contemporary philosophy. One nice example concerns utterances such as “It is\\nraining, but I do not believe that it is”; Moore observed that although such an\\nutterance is not self-contradictory (for it can be true both that it is raining\\nand that I do not believe that it is) it is an absurd thing to say. So the\\nchallenge is to explain just what makes the utterance absurd – a challenge\\nwhich remains a matter of active debate today. Wittgenstein called this puzzle “Moore’s\\nParadox” and wrote to Moore that it is an important discovery which shows that “logic\\nisn’t as simple as logicians think it is”. </p><p>Moore and Wittgenstein had known each other since 1912; looking back over this long acquaintance Moore commented in 1942 that he felt that Wittgenstein “was much cleverer at philosophy than I was … but also more profound”. During the early 1930s, with Wittgenstein’s approval, Moore attended many of Wittgenstein’s lectures and took detailed notes. This relationship made it easy for the two of them to meet for philosophical discussions, and these discussions, often twice a week, became a central and enduring feature of their relationship. Despite Wittgenstein’s sometimes critical remarks to his friends about Moore, it is a striking fact that Moore was his preferred philosophical interlocutor. Their philosophical relationship is best exemplified by Wittgenstein’s response to Moore’s discussions of “common sense”, as represented by Moore’s “Defence of Common Sense” (1925) and his “Proof of an External World” (1939). These famous papers include passages which are unlike anything to be found elsewhere in twentieth-century philosophical discussion: Moore’s “defence” begins with a list of common sense truisms concerning one’s presence in the world whose truth he says we all know for certain. And his “proof” (which is the text of a lecture) ends with him holding up his hands to his audience and arguing that by displaying his hands in this way he was giving a “conclusive proof” of their existence and thereby of the existence of an external world. These passages are an important part of Moore’s enduring legacy: as Wittgenstein recognized, Moore is pointing to familiar features of our understanding of ourselves, concerning things that we take to be certain and the ways in which we normally prove something that is straightforward. But, Wittgenstein also observed, Moore is not so good at elucidating what is mistaken about the familiar sceptical challenges to common sense. In his notes <em>On Certainty</em> Wittgenstein comments: “Moore’s mistake lies in this – countering the assertion that one cannot know that, by saying ‘I do know it’”. So in these notes, which are among his finest writings, Wittgenstein attempts the task which, in his judgement, Moore had failed to undertake – of developing conceptions of certainty and knowledge which do offer a “defence of common sense”, even though the resulting position has features which Moore himself would not have agreed with. </p><p>So was Moore a “great” philosopher? The question barely makes sense: we can generally agree what a great achievement might be; but, as the differences between the contents of volumes dedicated to “The Great Philosophers” indicate (compare German, French and British volumes) what is thought to make one philosopher great and another not is a highly subjective matter. Moore was certainly an important philosopher by challenging (if not refuting) the idealist philosophy which was dominant in Britain at the end of the nineteenth century, starting metaethical debates which continue today; and through his personality and his role as editor of <em>Mind</em>, he encouraged an inclusive but not uncritical style of philosophical debate which has become characteristic of contemporary philosophy in English. But his enduring contribution to philosophy lies primarily in the ways in which he challenged philosophical orthodoxy with simple arguments and examples, which have become part of the canon of twentieth-century philosophy. </p><p><em><strong>Thomas Baldwin</strong> is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the University of York</em></p>\",\"date\":\"2020-9-23\",\"link\":\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/g-e-moore-a-great-philosopher/\",\"discrp\":\"G.E.

Through the eyewitness testimony of H.F., a saddler from the White­chapel district of London who decides to remain in the city during the Great Plague of 1665, the book imagines one man’s attempt to avoid infection while confronting the horrors of an epidemic: the forced shutting up of houses, the plague pits barely able to contain the dead, the dissolution of social order. At age five Defoe had lived through the epidemic he would later fictionalize.</p><p>The Great Plague of 1665 had killed over 20 percent of the roughly 460,000 people living in London. The outbreak began in the small parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, just outside the city. When several unusual deaths, mostly of poor working-class people, were reported in 1664 and 1665, they were not directly connected to plague. While death counts from each part of London had been recorded and published in bills of mortality since 1603, these official records often underreported deaths, especially if they could lead to panic and civil unrest. This failure to identify a developing crisis and the delay in a municipal response led to sudden spikes in plague deaths by the summer of 1665, when nearly eight thousand people died in a single week. Like <a href=\\\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/contributors/dickens\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Dickens</a>’ novels of social reform over a century later, <em>A Journal of the Plague Year</em> illuminated the tragic personal and collective costs of unpreparedness, which greatly exacerbated the suffering of thousands of Londoners dying from bubonic plague.</p><p>By 1722 Defoe, businessman and government spy, had retired from such work and moved on to journalism and fiction. His 1719 novel <em>Robinson Crusoe</em>, which generated countless editions, sequels, and translations, was his first extended foray into fiction. He was prolific, writing two other novels in 1722—<em>Moll Flanders </em>and <em>Colonel Jack</em>—but only <em>A Journal of the Plague Year</em> was built upon the plague essays he had been publishing in periodicals like the<em> Daily Post </em>and <em>Applebee’s Original Weekly Journal </em>since 1709, covering topics such as the conditions of plague-ravaged France and the cruelty of household quarantine measures. His own memories of the epidemic, coupled with his research, made <em>A Journal of the Plague Year </em>so evocative that the book was believed to be a memoir authored—as the title page claimed—by an anonymous “citizen” instead of a novel penned by an already famous writer known for propaganda that had led to his numerous arrests. Commentary on the book did not even start mentioning Defoe’s authorship until the late eighteenth century, when critics began to debate whether the account could be considered history. The argument continued into 1920, when a <em>Times Literary Supplement</em> reviewer decreed, “Defoe is historian, not romancer.”</p><p>But only a month before the publication of <em>A Journal of the Plague Year</em>, Defoe released a work of nonfiction on epidemics, one that traded the quotidian experience of London’s plague past with didactic advice about what to do when a plague arrives at your doorstep. The earlier work, burdened with the title <em>Due Preparations for the Plague, as Well for Soul as Body: Being Some Seasonable Thoughts upon the Visible Approach of the Present Dreadful Contagion in France; the Properest Measures to Prevent It, and the Great Work of Submitting to It</em>, reads, as the literary scholar Louis A. Landa suggested, like “a manual of instruction” for how to act before the time of plague. At the age of sixty-two, Defoe believed he had a moral responsibility to “encourage the great work of preparation” at the individual and national levels before the next inevitable disaster.</p><p>Recognizing the threats to the growing British Empire, Defoe admits that “we are not a nation qualified so well to resist the progress of such a distemper, or the entrance of it into our country, as others are.” The British bodily constitution, plagued by its own excesses of gluttony and consumerism, desperately required what Defoe calls “the best preventive remedies,” ranging from strict dietary regimens to daily prayer for spiritual penitence, which prepare the body and soul for epidemic crises. For governments, he calls for “national preparations” that emphasize the separation of the sick from healthy, with particular attention given to the poor, the imprisoned, and children as vulnerable groups.</p><p>While the pestilential devastation of the Black Death in the fourteenth century remained very much alive in collective memory, the British response to plague outbreaks remained ad hoc and inconsistent. Well before the isolation of the <em>Yersinia pestis </em>bacterium, transmitted from rodents to humans via infected fleas, plague was typically attributed to an “afflictive providence” of a wrathful God. This theory of divine punishment coexisted with notions of plague as a natural calamity whose origins were often uncertain. Even as medical and scientific writers attempted to posit rational causes for epidemics, such as miasmas or person-to-person contact, they still frequently reproduced this ubiquitous religious language surrounding plague. <em>Due Preparations </em>embodies epidemic theory at its moment of transformation in the eighteenth century by conceiving of plague as both corporeal and spiritual phenomena.</p><p>Defoe juggled all these competing interests in his attempt to fashion an epidemic defense that would balance the personal and political, the economic and moral, the scientific and spiritual. He argued for dazzling civic choreography in a country that had thus far responded to epidemics with jerky policy reversals and whim-driven leaps into the unknown.</p><p><strong>B</strong>oth <em>Due Preparations </em>and <em>A Journal of the Plague Year</em> directly responded to the political and medical debates that had reached a high pitch by the 1720s. The British approach to plague tended to emphasize epidemic mitigation rather than prevention. Though the separation and restriction of people believed to be exposed to disease has its roots in Leviticus, quarantine as a plague-management strategy began in 1348 with Venice’s adoption of the policy and became increasingly popular during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, due in part to the rise of maritime trade. These quarantine policies affected later responses to epidemics by identifying seaports as places of transmission and structuring containment by controlling human movement through social isolation. Yet the lack of a singular, coherent understanding of plague, as well as inconsistent execution of quarantine policies since the Great Plague of 1665, prompted the English government to substantially revise its approach to disease management and public health. During the early years of the eighteenth century, Queen Anne and Parliament enforced some of England’s most rigorous quarantine protocols when an outbreak of plague occurred in the Baltic area during the Great Northern War (1700–1721) between the Russian tsardom and the Swedish Empire.</p><p>Under the Quarantine Act of 1710, all ships coming in and out of British ports from the Baltic were to be detained and monitored for the span of forty days (<em>quarantain</em> derives from the Latin <em>quarantena </em>and French <em>qua­rante</em>, meaning “forty”). During this time the inventory of any ship was to be opened and aired out, while all crew members or passengers needed to prove their good health or be isolated in confinement. In contrast to earlier measures, which ranged widely from bans on trade with countries suspected of infection to preventive burning of cargo, the 1710 act added the specter of harsh fines and punishments to the regulations, including authorizing the use of force by officials if they suspected a violation of the law. After reports of an outbreak in Marseille in 1720, Parliament deemed the previous act insufficient and amended it to include the “prohibition of commerce” for a year with any nation with infections; the establishment of lazarettos, designated quarantine stations to forcibly house passengers and crew; and the use of cordons sanitaires, policed boundaries around any city or town believed to have cases of infection. The severity and scale of these emendations signaled a shift in epidemic response toward aggressive intervention not only when outbreaks were reported but also if potential outbreaks were only suspected.</p><p>At the turn of the eighteenth century, medicine was undergoing revolutions in methodology drawn from seventeenth-century developments in “new science,” an experimental natural philosophy that emphasized empirical observation. Yet often the policies that would come to legislate British lives for decades failed to keep up with the constantly evolving nature of medical debates in this period. The writings of Richard Mead, who had served as Queen Anne’s personal physician toward the end of her life, provided the framework for the British government’s first attempt at organized quarantine policy as it tried to respond to its missteps in 1665. After receiving an education in physics and botany, Mead trained in medicine at Padua and returned to London to begin a medical practice. He first gained acclaim for his <em>Mechanical Account of Poisons </em>in 1702, which helped him become a member of the Royal Society of London and a lecturing physician at St. Thomas’ Hospital. George I’s Privy Council turned to Mead as a medical authority despite his never having worked with plague cases. Under the Privy Council’s orders, Mead laid out his theories about plague transmission in a 1720 tract titled <em>A Short Discourse Concerning Pestilential Contagion, and the Methods to Be Used to Prevent It</em>.</p><p>Mead thought both miasmatic and contagionist theories of infection should be used to understand plague. The former, from the ancient Greek <em>miasma</em>, or “pollution,” held that infection was a product of environmental factors such as contaminated water or tainted air thought to carry infectious matter. The latter posited that disease spread through individual bodies by direct contact. While Mead had reservations about the efficacy of household quarantine, he believed the quarantine of imported goods like fabrics essential, because they were more likely to be carriers of plague “effluvia” or “seeds of contagion.” He emphasized the dangers of commercial exchange, which Parliament limited in stringent quarantine policies aimed at mitigating “publick danger.” But Joseph Browne, Richard Blackmore, and other prominent physicians came out publicly against Mead’s theories as both contradictory and reductive. Browne refused to accept Mead’s attribution of plague to infected air, objects, and people and instead suggested that individuals with preexisting conditions or poor diets were inherently more susceptible to infection. Blackmore similarly emphasized individual constitution as a greater factor for infection than external sources like contaminated air. Mead’s treatise and the government’s adoption of his theories as the basis for policy provoked a pamphlet war among physicians over the best course of action for managing and preventing plague outbreaks. The intensity and volume of plague writings from this period underscores how little the medical community knew about plague’s etiology at the time of Defoe’s novel and treatise, and how much remained up for debate.</p><p>The infighting among physicians fueled many British citizens’ discontent with what they perceived as Parliament’s reckless disruption of British trade and unconstitutional violation of individual liberty. Frustration with the medical community’s lack of consensus and transparency, as well as Parliament’s eagerness to adopt such strict procedures of quarantine without certainty, led to a public backlash. Anonymous pamphlets joined the debate to decry the government’s deference to Mead’s medical authority despite emerging inconsistencies in his theories about causation and transmission.</p><p>This moment in British history underscores how public the conversations about plague were; citizens regularly engaged with issues of public policy and science. As Parliament discovered in the wake of highly organized campaigns against quarantine legislation, public health was hardly as simple as following medical advice. The En­glish government had to reckon with one of public health’s central tensions, between individual choice and the needs of the wider community. Though Parliament ultimately capitulated to the outcry, it acknowledged the pitfalls of remaining too loose with its pandemic response. Even if the government had to violate the rights of English citizens, it was doing so in order to prevent another disaster at the magnitude of the Great Plague of 1665. If the empire was to have a future, the health of the nation would have to take precedence.</p><p><strong>M</strong>ake no mistake: Defoe meant for <em>Due Preparations </em>to be a manual. It is didactic by design, and it is also a political intervention, advocating for preventive care as a matter of national importance. In distinguishing “preparations against the plague” from “preparations for the plague” and specifying that the former were preparations for the body, the latter for the soul, he emphasizes that such preparations are not just meant for times of plague. For Defoe, preparedness is a long-term, holistic project of self-management predicated on the idea that crisis is always “impending.” While almost always pursued belatedly because individuals tend to remain distracted by the trivialities of their daily lives, “put[ting] ourselves in a posture” of preparedness can at least defer, if only for a short while, suffering and regret. Defoe acknowledges that most English people will not prepare early enough, but even the awareness that actions can be taken in advance could make a difference for survival.</p><p>To convey the urgency of his advice, Defoe likens England and the bodies of its citizens to fortresses under siege. In his metaphor of the national body, England is already infiltrated by a potential sickness within that “confederate[s] with the enemy without.” To respond to illness after it has manifested is already too late:</p><p>Echoing Browne’s and Blackmore’s arguments that internal constitution helps determine the body’s vulnerability to infection, Defoe points out that the English create their own vulnerabilities to plague through their habits of excessive eating and drinking. Such self-indulgence conspires with plague to weaken and eventually destroy a body that is not even aware of its own incremental self-destruction. To prevent this the body must fortify its own natural defenses through moderation and proper humoral balance. Applying military metaphors used throughout history to describe encounters with disease, Defoe declares that citizens must be alert and responsive, the foundations of their bodily garrisons laid well before plague’s attack. In the violent battle against plague, the complacent are fools holding a candle around magazines of gunpowder: they needlessly court risk and lose the battle before it is even fought, when safety was entirely possible with proper planning. Anticipating later health treatises like George Cheyne’s <em>The En­glish Malady </em>(1733), Defoe’s <em>Due Preparations</em> characterizes the English as having a predisposition to weakness and a refusal to acknowledge it as a problem. Plague, for Defoe, merely exposes the manifold ways in which the English are unprepared for crisis at every level of society, from the individual body to the national body.</p><p>Although every citizen plays a vital role in strengthening their own bodily defenses, Defoe emphasizes that the labor of plague preparation also “must be the work of the government.” While he endorsed maritime quarantine and restrictions on free trade, he departed from Richard Mead’s more austere approach to quarantine. Defoe deliberately draws attention to the French origins of the plague outbreaks during the 1720s and the inefficacy of cordons sanitaires in curtailing the spread in Marseille and Toulon. Framing his critique in terms of national difference—and cannily emphasizing British superiority at a moment of intense commercial and political rivalry with France, which had been escalating since the Restoration—Defoe argues that strategies borrowed from France made plague outbreaks more damaging by forcing the sick and the healthy to remain in contact and wasting military and economic resources to do it. A more compassionate and appropriately English response would allow sick people to remain within city limits, while encouraging the healthy to relocate away from dense urban centers. Household quarantine effectively damned both healthy and sick by locking them up to die together. In contrast to Mead’s emphasis on what scholar Wayne Wild describes as “interdiction by the authorities,” Defoe emphasizes the “experience of the individual—how to assume such an unnatural and strict isolation of self and family, or worse, self from family (whether self-imposed or ordered by governing bodies), in order to be spared painful illness and death.” Such individualizing, like his choice to narrate the entirety of <em>A Journal of the Plague Year </em>through the singular experience of H.F., makes Defoe’s prescriptions from <em>Due Preparations</em> accessible to citizens less educated than physicians like Richard Mead or less privileged than George I.</p><p>Defoe’s writings imagine public health as a national project shaped by public response. His long-standing reputation as an astute public commentator amplified the movement to repeal the Quarantine Act of 1721. Parliament amended it one year later owing to mounting protests. Because Defoe had the standing and knowledge to credibly challenge Mead, one of the most eminent physicians of the day, and the government that had aligned itself with him, Defoe was able to arm the aldermen and merchants petitioning Parliament with practical and moral arguments against other extreme measures of disease management, such as the use of cordons sanitaires and the confinement by force of individuals to pesthouses and lazarettos, both of which punitively regulated citizens to disastrous socioeconomic effects. Critics of the shutting up of homes emphasized how such measures seemed to punish and stigmatize the ill, which Defoe literalizes in the scenes of London homes being marked by red crosses to signify the infected within. In line with popular beliefs of plague as punishment, this form of quarantine effectively condemned the healthy as equally culpable just by their proximity to the sick. The English government’s well-meaning policy decisions were met with resistance because they did not sufficiently attend to lived experience. Preparedness, for Defoe, needed to be a closer collaboration between individual citizens and the state, one in which both parties understood their social and ethical responsibilities to each other. To be prepared involved much more human work.</p><p><strong>T</strong>he title of <em>Due Preparations </em>promised advice on how to preserve the soul as well as the body during the plague, and Defoe devotes the latter half to matters of faith. Drawing upon a sixteenth- and seventeenth-century tradition of plague writing established by the tracts of Thomas Dekker, <a href=\\\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/epidemic/last-words\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Thomas Nashe</a>, and <a href=\\\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/contributors/bullein\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">William Bullein</a>, he illustrates the urgency of spiritual preparation through a moralistic tale about an unnamed English family’s experience of the 1665 plague. Shifting from the more logical arguments about disease prevention laid out in the first section, Defoe stages a series of ongoing dialogues between a “pious and serious mother” and her two merchant sons with “heads and hearts…wholly taken up with business and the world.”</p><p>At first chiding their mother for being “melancholic” and paranoid, the brothers slowly discover the costs of not being “better prepared,” as they lose their business and earthly possessions in the chaos of the outbreak. Plague’s sudden, painful arrival gives them no time to repent and find peace with divine providence, despite their mother’s personal entreaties to prepare. Though one brother is redeemed by the will of his faithful sister moving him to penitence, the other ignores them and suffers alone for failing to build “a good and solid foundation” for his own life.</p><p><span>Defoe’s parable reinforces his philosophy of individual preparedness by encouraging not just bodily preparation but spiritual reckoning: “Our work, in short, is self-examination and repentance; first examination, then humiliation.” Without this humbling process of self-criticism, no amount of material preparation will be sufficient, especially if it reinforces old habits that otherwise endanger people with a false sense of security before the next visitation of the plague. Raised a Presbyterian Dissenter, which already made him critical of the state’s interference in religious belief in the name of the Anglican Church, Defoe emphasizes the interior work of spiritual reflection as the most valuable preparation. It is also the most difficult, requiring self-discipline when there seems to be no crisis at hand. By teaching his readers to comprehend the real “difference between the prepared and the unprepared,” he galvanizes them to preemptive action that will not only preserve them but also reform them for a life after crisis.</span></p><p><span>After the Great Fire of 1666, which incinerated much of central London less than a year after the plague’s visitation, Britain faced the daunting task of radically rebuilding the city while also reimagining its response to crisis with new forms of preparedness. In the form of a practical guide,</span><em> Due Preparations </em><span>collects and expands the insights of over fifty years of change in British medicine and governance since the Great Plague into a series of epidemic prescriptions. But why publish </span><em>A Journal of the Plague Year </em><span>concurrently with </span><em>Due Preparations</em><span>? The </span><em>Journal</em><span> ’s return to the events of 1665 enables Defoe to share the untold histories of those who witnessed “the face of London…strangely altered” by plague and to whom his work is indebted. The forms of devastation that H.F. witnesses are not inevitable; they are the products of multiple failures to prepare for epidemic’s contingencies. Rather than depend solely on his future-oriented treatise to convince his readers, Defoe’s retrospective novel imagines the very real personal consequences of refusing to prepare or not knowing how to prepare at all. Preparation, he suggests, is an ongoing practice of learning to live together with crisis.</span></p>\",\"date\":\"2020-9-21\",\"link\":\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/epidemic/what-preparations-are-due\",\"discrp\":\"Disease in the time of Defoe.
