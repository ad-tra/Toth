Perhaps she’d mistaken him for one of his portraits, because over the previous decades no artist had been better at manipulating canvas and paint to give the illusion of real human bodies, stilled lives. Everything about a self-portrait like Reflection (1985), from its intent pink-rimmed eyes to the shiny patch on its forehead, makes it look as if it is not a painting but a person, who is on the verge of leaning out of the frame to touch the viewer—though whether to kiss them or headbutt them it is hard to say.</p><p>All portraits are more than simple objects. A portrait is the representation of one body that has been created by the touch of another; it is a silent duet, a stationary pas de deux. That is why, in Freud’s view, not everyone was a suitable subject to be painted by him. It is also why, according to William Feaver in the superb second volume of this eye-opening biography, Freud’s quest for people to be persuaded or seduced into sitting for him never ceased. Actually there usually wasn’t much sitting involved once Freud had managed to get you into his studio. Most models were expected to remove their clothes and splay themselves on a bed or a pile of rags, often holding uncomfortable poses for hours at a time. And if they were young and female Freud didn’t restrict himself to touching up their portraits. Sometimes he would come close and fondle their bones and muscles like “a trainer in a racing stable running a hand idly over brisket and withers.” At other times he went further still. “To sit was to serve, more often than not in more than one capacity,” Feaver writes, evenly.</p><p>Some models failed to return once they realised that, although Freud was fascinated by their bodies, their own names would never appear in any catalogue or gallery; they were merely a way for the portrait to achieve its own form of independent life. Others had to accept that he was going to depict what he really saw rather than perpetuate a more flattering public image of them. Supermodel Kate Moss was painted while she was pregnant, and at the base of her real spine Freud tattooed her with two swallows set like inverted commas. (“An original Freud,” she boasted, adding that if the modelling work dried up “I could get a skin graft and sell it.”) A small portrait of the Queen was commissioned after Freud was awarded the Order of Merit in 1993, capturing a face that appeared to be at once eminently practical and unexpectedly fond of sly jokes. (Both of these characteristics were revealed when the Queen was reported to have said that she stayed as silent as she could during the sittings, “Because when he talks he stops painting.”)</p><p>Alongside these star models there were ordinary people like the picture framer Louise Liddell, painted as Woman Holding Her Thumb (1992). She once cursed God for her fat ankles, whereupon Freud said “I thank God for them.” There were also plenty of approaches from strangers volunteering their services. “A man wrote to me and said, ‘I’m sure you’d like to paint me because I have no ears, despite which I’m a vicar,’” Freud told Feaver. And of course there were chance encounters with potential models he spotted in bars or clubs, such as a “rather amazing girl with a sore part under her nose as if she’d been up to something,” whom Freud thought that getting to know would be “rather exhilarating.”</p><p>There are echoes here of the first volume of Feaver’s biography, which was packed with good stories about Freud’s rackety private life and rollicking friendships with fellow artists like Francis Bacon. The same elements are also present in this second volume, including some splendid vignettes of Freud kicking a gallery owner he disliked (“Treated it like a penalty kick: just a quick below-the-kneecap”) and trying to deal with the many children he had sired over the years, not all of whom he “recognised,” as Feaver neatly puts it. The main difference is that here these stories are little more than bits of highlighting, like the patch of shiny skin in Reflection. Instead the focus throughout this volume is on Freud’s daily routine in his studio: a spacious top-floor flat in 36 Holland Park, where two or three different scenes could be arranged under the skylight at any one time, and where the walls gradually filled up with paint scraping and scribbled phone numbers. If Feaver’s first volume was a portrait of the artist playing around, here the main focus is Freud at work.</p><p>Sometimes, Feaver reports, when a painting was nearing completion, Freud would step back from the canvas and “as though taunting himself” would murmur “How far can you go?” It is a question that goes to the heart of his career. In his younger days it had encouraged him to steal from his parents and gamble money that wasn’t his to stake. Now that he was an established artist the main uncertainty was what would happen each time he started a new work.</p><p>It was a wager that he was always in danger of losing, and his studio filled with abandoned canvases bearing only a few experimental smudges of paint. His etchings were riskier still, because each time an image was scratched into the metal plate and dipped, there was the chance that it could become a blurry mess. Even the paintings he carried on with were surprisingly unpredictable until he decided that they were finished, and Feaver does an excellent job of letting us look over Freud’s shoulder as he goes about his work in the studio. Impulses are explored and later painted out; tiny physical details are given the attention usually reserved for whole lives (“Got up at half past four with the intention of doing the handle on the easel,” in The Painter Surprised by a Naked Admirer); extra strips of canvas are attached to widen the original painting, as his model stretches out and Freud tries to give them enough space to be themselves: “Allow the life full swing.”</p><p>The finished painting was not a vision that had been realised, like an architectural plan that had become a real building. Instead it depicted a relationship that had developed over the weeks or months Freud and his model had spent together. As David Hockney astutely observed of the portrait Freud painted of him in 2002, “It’s not me; it’s an account of looking at me by a very intelligent and skilled painter.” Sometimes these relationships lasted a lifetime, like the astonishing series of portraits Freud produced of his mother, in which the longer he spent in her company the further she seemed to withdraw inside her own head; or they unfolded over several years, as in Freud’s portraits of the performance artist Leigh Bowery, a man who somehow combined the bulk of a heavyweight wrestler with the grace and poise of a ballet dancer. At other times they did not unfold so much as unravel, as when Freud tried to include the model Jerry Hall in a group portrait, and later painted over her to turn her into a man after she failed to turn up to all the sittings he had demanded.</p><p>Another comment by Hockney about portrait-painting—“It’s a duration, not a moment”—might also be applied to the most important relationship in this book, between Freud and his biographer. As a young art critic Feaver first got to know Freud in 1973, and it wasn’t long before his life was caught up in the painter’s slipstream. They would talk regularly on the phone, sometimes more than once a day (“Hello, Villiam. How goes it?”), and as Feaver assembled a record of these conversations it seems that the notoriously private Freud gradually reconciled himself to the appearance of a biography in which he would not be analysed too much—throughout his life the ghost of his grandfather Sigmund continued to hang heavily over the family—and would usually be allowed the last word.</p><p>What kind of book did he expect? Apparently in conversation he referred to it as Feaver’s “funny art book,” and like the first volume this second instalment contains some excellent stories. We are told about Freud posing a Japanese laboratory rat after first tranquillising it with champagne and sleeping pills; Freud dealing with difficult social situations by reciting chunks of “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” to himself; Freud’s neck-craning response to a traffic accident outside his studio: “I hoped there’d be arms and legs lying around. I need that for something.” The main narrative is also punctuated by Freud’s waspish one-liners, which Feaver reports with neutral relish. On Mother Theresa: “Not someone to sit next to at lunch.” On his brother Clement: “We never got on. He’s dead now. Always was, actually.” For the most part Feaver seems happy to act as Freud’s comic stooge, giving his friend the best lines and only occasionally adding an aside of his own, as when he reports Freud’s confident claim that “I like ironing. Everyone does,” before quietly adding in parenthesis: “[This from someone who had rarely, if ever, used an ironing board.]”</p><p>The jokes are important, because although it is a common assumption that artists lead tragic lives—garrets, starvation, doomed love affairs and so on—as seen through Feaver’s eyes Freud’s life was more like a comedy. That wasn’t just because it was a story with a happy ending, as the prices of his paintings grew from tens of thousands to millions of pounds, accompanied by retrospective shows at venues like the Centre Pompidou and the Tate, and including frequent trips on Concorde or his New York dealer’s private jet. It is also because throughout Freud seems to have behaved like a modern clown: a figure who was driven by strong appetites, told the truth when it was uncomfortable or unwanted, and used paint to play a complicated game in which self-revelation was strangely mixed up with self-disguise.</p><p>The main difference, of course, is that clowns never seem to age, whereas at the time that Freud complained “I’m not an object,” his spark was already starting to fade. It is painful to read about someone’s decline in a biography and especially so when the subject was as full of life—and of lives—as Freud. From the earliest signs of approaching old age, which took the form of arthritic pains in one shoulder, to the final months of cancer and mental confusion leading up to his death in 2011, Freud’s decline is outlined by Feaver in the unsentimental way his subject would probably have wanted. There are even echoes of Freud’s unfinished portraits in the way Feaver spaces out the final years, producing the narrative equivalent of physical gaps left on an abandoned canvas. The result is a biography that is as generous and unsparing as Freud’s own best work. At once personally intimate and critically detached, perceptive on the art (his summary of one etching is that the model has “the look of one who rather thought she’d just forgotten something frightfully important”) but never trying to compete with it, Feaver’s biographical portrait is an unforgettable achievement.</p><p>In the end he also recognises that his subject will unavoidably slip through his fingers. Soon after they first met, Freud appeared at Feaver’s front door looking tense and asking for him. They arranged to meet again the next day, before Freud “paused on the step as though deciding what further to say then turned and vanished into the dark.” At the time it might have seemed merely shy or elusive. Now it reads more like an allegory of the biographical enterprise.</p><p>The big ideas that are shaping our world— straight to your inbox.

One had “this fragment of a story by Chekhov: ‘… and suddenly everything became clear to him’”. For Carver, these words are “filled with wonder and possibility. I love their simple clarity, and the hint of revelation that’s implied. There is mystery, too. What has been unclear before? Why is it just now becoming clear? What’s happened? Most of all – what now?” The quote might not belong to Anton Chekhov at all (no one has ever found the story it’s from), but Carver’s description of its effect, its ability to stage a revelation and in the same moment open a field of greater mystery, absolutely does.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tRichard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky’s new translation of 52 Chekhov stories doesn’t include many of his most famous works (their versions of those can be found in a collection from 2000, only available in the UK as an e-book). But walking the overgrown pathways of his less familiar stories can help give a fresh sense of why his storytelling has been so influential, and remains compelling in its own right.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tConsider the last page of “Neighbours”, from 1892, in which Pyotr Mikhailych, a young man who “already had all the makings of an old bachelor landowner”, sits miserably beside a pond as the moon rises. He thinks he sees a man across the water, standing motionless. Remembering a story about a seminarian who was beaten to death nearby, he wonders if this is his ghost. But when he rides around the pond the figure turns out to be no more than a rotten post, the remnant of some old shed.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tPyotr’s uncertainty is quickly resolved. But for us, reading Chekhov’s often indeterminate, emotionally puzzling stories, the solution is not so simple. In the closing lines Pyotr reflects that he has never said or done what he really wanted to, “and therefore the whole of life now looked to him as dark as this water in which the night sky was reflected and waterweeds were entangled. And it seemed to him that it could not be set right.”\\n</p><p>\\n\\tThe extremity of Pyotr’s realisation is a shock, a surprise ending of sorts, yet while these are usually enlisted to tie things up, here very little feels settled. Earlier in the story Pyotr visits the estate of his neighbour Vlasich, the divorcé his younger sister Zina is now living with. “Neighbours” might be relatively minor Chekhov (written just a couple of months after “Ward No 6”, one of his most famous stories), but Pyotr’s visit to Vlasich shows him at his most skilful, conjuring a full spectrum of emotion from a stream of conversation that’s now sludgy and mannered, now running fast with emotion and revelation, now drying up completely (“The two were silent for a time and pretended to be listening to the rain”).\\n</p><p>\\n\\tThe longer the characters talk, or don’t talk, the more can be interpreted and the less clear everything becomes. Pyotr cannot talk to Zina the way he used to, perhaps because her liaison with Vlasich has sexualised her in his eyes. But is he jealous of Zina for finding love, which has eluded him, or jealous of Vlasich and in love with his sister? “I don’t even know for certain what I actually think,” he despairs beside the pond.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tChekhov works to sustain this uncertainty and plunges us into it too. Revising the story, he deleted a line that seemed too definitive: “I had gone to settle something, but not a single one of life’s questions can have a special solution; in each separate case you must say and do what you think – that is the solution to all questions.” Lines like this survived the red pen in other stories he wrote, but they never appear as conclusions. “In my opinion,” he told Ivan Bunin the first time the writers met, “after one finishes a story one should cross out the beginning and the end. It is there that we writers lie most of all.” The end of a Chekhov story is nearly always left ajar.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tChekhov’s grandfather was a serf who purchased his freedom. His father was a shopkeeper in Taganrog, on the Sea of Azov, and a tyrant (the story “Difficult People” provides a damning portrait). His insolvency, coupled with Chekhov’s early success as a writer of comic stories at the age of 20, having moved to Moscow to attend medical school, made the third son the family’s breadwinner. Chekhov practised medicine alongside writing, saying that it “significantly broadened the scope of my observations, and has enriched me with branches of knowledge whose true value for me as a writer can only be understood by someone who is a doctor himself”.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tChekhov is hardly a writer’s writer, but it might be said that short story writers believe, correctly or not, that they alone understand his true value. Carver is one of many who have learned the lessons Chekhov’s work teaches. On the cover of my copy of Carver’s Elephant (1988) a review quote describes him as “the American Chekhov”. “Errand”, the last story in the book and the last Carver saw published in his lifetime, describes Chekhov’s death. But the more important connection is his distinctively Chekhovian manner of dispersing meaning into apparently irrelevant details, and the pronounced open-endedness of his stories. Carver, however, was not the only American Chekhov: by the 1980s the appellation was threadbare with use. Addressing Cornell University’s Chekhov Festival in 1976, John Cheever told his audience he was “one of perhaps ten American writers who are known as the American Chekhov”.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tThe description isn’t unhelpful because it’s used carelessly, but because Chekhov’s influence is so widespread: most short story writers are Chekhovians, whether they realise it or not. Playwrights, too: asked about his influences Tennessee Williams replied, “Chekhov! As a dramatist? Chekhov! As a story writer? Chekhov!” Keeping to the short story in English, early disciples included Katherine Mansfield, Sherwood Anderson and Ernest Hemingway, and from here his influence quickly ramifies: AE Coppard, Katherine Anne Porter, Eudora Welty, Flannery O’Connor, Bernard Malamud, John Cheever, Raymond Carver, Alice Munro, Yiyun Li and Joyce Carol Oates, who rewrote him with her “Lady with the Pet Dog”. This is only a sampling.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tAll these writers have learned from what Elizabeth Bowen, another disciple, called the “inchoate or nebulous” quality of Chekhov’s stories. In 1937 she wrote that he “opened up for the writer tracts of emotional landscape; he made subjectivity edit and rule experience and pull art, obliquely, its way”. It is as if he made a more finely graduated colour wheel available to the writers who followed him, summoning into being what Conrad Aiken called, in a 1921 essay, “a range of states of consciousness which is perhaps unparalleled”. Mood, Aiken suggests, was both Chekhov’s method and effect. If his characters seem unmemorable next to those of, say, Tolstoy, “it is because so often our view of them was never permitted for a moment to be external – we saw them only as infinitely fine and truthful sequences of mood”.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tThis wasn’t enough for Somerset Maugham, who devoted an inordinate amount of the preface for his own collected stories to simultaneously praising and burying Chekhov. Maugham cannot take his tendency towards the oblique: “If you try to tell one of his stories,” he complains, “you will find that there is nothing to tell.” Doubtless Chekhov “would have written stories with an ingenious, original and striking plot if he had been able to think of them. It was not in his temperament. Like all good writers he made a merit of his limitations.”\\n</p><p>\\n\\tThe truth is that Chekhov’s approach was essentially lyrical, and he was never interested in the things Maugham says he fails to achieve. As DS Mirsky noted in his 1926 History of Russian Literature, when reading Chekhov “it is not interest in the development [of the story] that the reader feels, but ‘infection’ by the poet’s mood”.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tThis mood is often one of inertia. This is particularly true of the mature period, which began in 1888 when Chekhov stopped writing weekly comic stories and began publishing in the so-called “thick journals”, which afforded him greater time and space. At the end of “The Lady with the Little Dog”, “Fear”, “Big Volodya and Little Volodya”, and numerous others, the characters return more or less to wherever they were when the story began – minus some of their illusions – or poised at the lip of an uncertain future.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tFor the translator Michael Henry Heim, the fact that in these stories “things peter out or go on as they have before” – that they stop, rather than conclude – “does not mean that nothing has happened; it means that nothing – or, rather, less than the characters may have hoped for – has changed”. It’s an important distinction. The stasis Chekhov’s stories so often describe (“My life had become boring again, like it had been before,” as the landscape painter N remarks at the end of “The House with the Mezzanine”) isn’t heightened in the manner of Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot, but emotionally mimetic. Where change does occur it doesn’t provide completion, but only reveals a new set of problems; in a letter of 1888 Chekhov said it wasn’t an author’s job to give answers, but formulate the right questions.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tGuy de Maupassant is the only genuine rival to Chekhov in terms of shaping the modern short story. Although Chekhov borrowed from Maupassant – a debt he nods to in The Seagull – they were very different writers, and the difference is starkest in how they approach endings. Maupassant favoured ones that snap shut: the payload that the story’s mechanism delivers. Impressive, often ingenious, but cold and cynical; a story that closes as smartly as a joke can render hollow whatever life it has called into being.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tBy contrast, Chekhov’s method allows his stories to become part of the continuum of a reader’s day: less memorable in their specifics, but more persistent in effect. Their ragged edges possess an uncanny ability to knit themselves into our memories as things felt, as ongoing “sequences of mood”. “I want the story to exist somewhere so that in a way it’s still happening,” Alice Munro has said, “or happening over and over again. I don’t want it to be shut up in the book and put away – oh well, that’s what happened.” Chekhov would agree with every word of this.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tMeaning is provisional in even the most apparently self-explanatory of Chekhov’s stories. “The Student”, from 1895, was Chekhov’s own favourite. It describes Ivan, a seminarian, walking home after a cold spring afternoon’s shooting. He stops beside the fire of two peasant women, a mother and daughter. The fire reminds him of the gospel story of Peter denying Jesus. He tells it, the old woman begins to cry, and a tense expression comes to her daughter’s face as though she is stifling pain.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tThe story ends with Ivan analysing what just happened. He decides the women’s reactions prove their connection to the story of Peter, which inspires a realisation regarding the interconnectedness of past and present, “an unbroken chain of events, which flowed from one into another”. Most analyses of the story take this at face value, despite Chekhov’s atheism, but doing so ignores his tendencies to a remarkable degree.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tFor one thing, setting is never accidental in Chekhov – his landscapes, for example, filled with “mournfully drooping willows”, “malicious” storms and “disgusting” rains, are consistently anthropomorphic – and when Ivan interprets the women’s reactions the fire flickers in the darkness some way behind him, and they are no longer visible. Just as they are physically obscured, perhaps the truth behind their reactions is also beyond his ability to see. We have been told, seemingly incidentally, that the daughter, a widow, was beaten by her husband. Perhaps Ivan’s mention of the beating of Jesus brought back her own pain. Her mother’s tears might not be spurred by faith, but by shame for giving her daughter to such a man. “The Student” is a story about storytelling, after all, and it is in the nature of Chekhov’s stories to be profoundly unstable.\\n</p><p>\\n\\tCritical consensus says Ivan’s revelation is genuine. This is understandable; Bunin reports that Chekhov thought “The Student” contradicted those critics who called him “gloomy”. But regardless of his intent, it is notable that even in such a brief story his impulse for ambiguity and irresolution should result in the availability of more than one reading. “Everything on this earth,” Chekhov wrote in a letter of 1887, “is relative and inexact,” and this apprehension permeates his work. As the farmer Alekhin comments in “About Love”, before telling a story of unspoken words and unresolved feeling, “We decent Russian people entertain a partiality for these questions that remain without answers.” \\n</p>\",\"date\":\"2020-8-28\",\"link\":\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2020/08/how-chekhov-invented-modern-short-story\",\"discrp\":\"“After one finishes a story, one should cross out the beginning and the end,\\\" said Chekhov. \\\"It is there that we writers lie most of all”  .\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","{\"content\":\"<p>‘Let’s face the considerable evidence that all sitting is harmful,” writes Galen Cranz, a design historian whose book The Chair traces this object’s long history. Not all sitting, of course. For people who use wheelchairs, they’re an elegant and crucial technology. And sitting itself is not the culprit; any unchanging, repetitive motion or posture fails to give the body the variation it needs. But Cranz, writing primarily for an audience of ambulatory readers in industrialised and therefore sedentary societies, is one of many researchers who have been saying for decades that chairs are a major cause of pain and disability.</p><p>Sitting for hours and hours can weaken your back and core muscles, pinch the nerves of your rear end and constrain the flow of blood that your body needs for peak energy and attention. Most people’s bodies are largely unsuited to extended periods in these structures. Extensive research confirms that sitting in chairs is correlated, Cranz notes, with “back pain of all sorts, fatigue, varicose veins, stress and problems with the diaphragm, circulation, digestion, elimination and general body development”. There is growing evidence that relentlessly sedentary jobs – in some, such as bus driving and forklift operating, bodies are literally strapped to chairs – are harmful enough to shorten life expectancy.</p><p>For most of human history, a mix of postures was the norm for a body meeting the world. Squatting has been as natural a posture as sitting for daily tasks, and lying down was a conventional pose for eating in some ancient cultures. So why has sitting in chairs persisted in so many modern cultures? As with all material objects, Cranz reminds us, function tells only part of the story. The other part, always, is culture – the inherited and sometimes arbitrary ways that things have always been done, and therefore continue as common practice. “Biology, physiology and anatomy have less to do with our chairs than pharaohs, kings and executives,” she writes.</p><p>One kind of historical chair, called the “klismos” by historians, developed primarily as a historical expression of status. Setting a body higher than and apart from other people, in an individual structure with rigid, flat planes – a throne, if you will – evolved as a way of recognising an individual’s power, with the earliest known models dating to ancient Egypt and south-eastern Europe. Their use as an expression of authority continued throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and the endurance of this symbolism lives on as metaphor in many contemporary leadership titles; to chair the committee or the department, or to sit in the designated “director’s chair” on a film set, is still to hold a seat of power.</p><p>In the centuries prior to western industrialisation, stools or benches were common household furnishings, but chairs were special-occasion objects, usually the exclusive property of the wealthy and powerful. The era of mass manufacturing in the 19th century, and the rapid social and economic changes that came with it, brought chairs into daily life for the first time. Industrial jobs, with their repetitive tasks, required a seated posture, and the high demand for chairs that this created in turn made them available and affordable to middle-class people in Europe and the US.</p><p>“Chair-and-table culture,” Cranz writes, has become fully entrenched in many parts of the world since then. Modern interior designers have done their part to perpetuate chairs as a fashionable and practical norm, reinventing the form again and again in its aesthetics, though not nearly enough in its ergonomics. Chairs are four-legged creatures with anatomical backs and bottoms, familiar to humans because they stand up, almost like animals, beckoning us with their lifelike structures to sit down. Cranz notes that they appeal to humans, and perhaps especially designers, with this blend of the “architectonic and the anthropomorphic”: they are structurally interesting and an echo of the body itself.</p><p>But while they remind us of the human form, chairs rarely do much to actually support it. For instance, many chair designs feature big, soft cushions that seem to indicate comfort, but in ergonomics, the consensus contradicts this padded aesthetic. Cranz writes that “an overpadded chair forces the sit bones to rock in the padding rather than make contact with a stable surface, thereby forcing the flesh in the butt and thighs to bear weight”.</p><p>How can a nice cushioned chair that screams comfort be so ill-suited to most actual bodies? The real science of ergonomics, Cranz argues, should point designers toward chair design that supports and enables the body’s need for movement, not stillness – with seats that angle downward in front, for example, and have a base that’s flexible enough for the sitter to shift their body weight from leg to leg. But for the most part, these principles are ignored in favour of fashion and cheap manufacturing.</p><p>Chairs are generally not a response to the realities of the body, its natural evolution, or its needs over any extended period. Instead, the industrialised body has devolved in its needs and succumbed to chairs. “We design them,” Cranz writes, repurposing a famous line of Winston Churchill’s, “but once built, they shape us.”</p><p>Naturally, there have been plenty of attempts by designers to reinvent sitting. There are kneeling chairs, bouncing balls, perch-style stools with rounded bottoms to encourage shifts in weight and movement. There are flexibly designed chairs such as the Tripp Trapp for children, with pegs for adjusting the seat and leg supports to grow with a young body. Some offices have started to introduce standing desks. But at the average restaurant, in the ordinary classroom, and on trains, buses and aeroplanes, you’ll still find chairs that are mostly at odds with any idea of comfort.</p><p>It’s not just chairs, of course – so many of the products brought to market by the profession of industrial design were not created for many bodies. Instead, they were designed to be plentiful, novel rather than necessary, and cheap. One famous designer, Victor Papanek, memorably dubbed these bad designs a form of “do-it-yourself murder”.</p><p>“Never before in history have grown men sat down and seriously designed electric hairbrushes, rhinestone-covered file boxes, and mink carpeting for bathrooms, and then drawn up elaborate plans to make and sell the gadgets to millions of people,” he wrote in 1971. “Today, industrial design has put murder on a mass-production basis. By designing criminally unsafe automobiles that kill or maim nearly 1 million people around the world each year, by creating whole new species of permanent garbage to clutter up the landscape, and by choosing materials and processes that pollute the air we breathe, designers have become a dangerous breed.”</p><p>Papanek was calling out his entire profession when he wrote these words. Design for the Real World, his first book, was a fiercely argued polemic about the misguided operations of industrial design in the mid-20th century, a call for designers to question what Papanek witheringly referred to as “shroud design” – a preoccupation with the way things look on the outside, at the expense of how they should function and how robustly and sustainably they are made. He understood how the products with which we navigate daily life match (or fail to match) the bodies and tasks they are meant to conjoin as tools. He likened his peers’ shirking of their responsibilities to “what would happen if all medical doctors were to forsake general practice and surgery, and concentrate exclusively on dermatology and cosmetics”.</p><p>Papanek was responding to the heady early days of truly mass manufacturing in the aftermath of the second world war, when supply chains expanded to previously unimaginable scale, fuelled by an equally huge advertising industry. Papanek understood the job of product design to be an ambitious one – to “transform man’s environment and tools and, by extension, man himself” – but he saw in the giddiness of postwar growth a moment when designers lost their way. An overwhelming cultural belief and investment in technology created a cultural appetite for whatever seemed shiny and new, and the industry now pandered to it.</p><p>The public’s ready acceptance of these shiny new objects, whose lifespan was meant to last only until the next new thing arrived, created an allegiance among designers to what Papanek called “the dark twins of styling and obsolescence”. Manufacturing for styling, amplified by advertising, resulted in an empty desire for unnecessary objects that became quickly unusable. And objects that were created purely for ephemeral desire, in turn, created a whole ethos of obsolescence – an accepted disposability that made for a dangerous neglect of safety standards, resulting in needless injury from common household objects. At the time of his writing, he claimed that 600 women annually lost a hand in injuries brought about by top-loading washing machines. When operating at its worst, design resulted in needless injury, but in its everyday mediocrity it also created conditions where objects were not in harmony with the needs of the people for whom they were designed.</p><p>As Papanek observed, there is a wide gulf between the people who use TV remotes, car dashboards and other everyday items, and the people who make the design decisions that bring those items into being, who are driven or constrained by motives other than ease of use. The bodiedness of people gets lost, especially in the sedentary workplace, where human labour is imagined not as flesh and muscles, but as measurable economic deliverables, organised by roles and tasks. Yet the work is carried out by bodies all the same, not just in chairs, but among the angular shapes of desks and copiers and countertops, alongside mechanical and digital machines. The passive as well as active physical requirements of our workdays tax our bodies, whether we bend repeatedly to harvest berries or sit still in a phone bank for hours on end.</p><p>Papanek was particularly barbed in his assessment of design’s failure to allow for non-normative bodies. He called for a much closer focus on people and conditions whose needs were commonly written off by his design counterparts as “special”: older people, people with disabilities, elementary school students, and any population considered beyond the scope of the middling mainstream. But as Papanek pointed out, we were all children once, and almost all of us become, in turn, adolescents, middle-aged people and older adults. If we combine all the “seemingly little minorities [and their] ‘special’ needs,” he wrote, we discover that “we have designed for the majority after all”.</p><p>Post-Papanek, designers continued to wrestle with the conundrum of chairs. In the late 70s, the office furniture giant Herman Miller commissioned independent designers Bill Stumpf and Don Chadwick to look for opportunities in the furniture market, gaps that new products might fill and thereby expand the company’s market share. In the course of their research, Stumpf and Chadwick, seasoned observers of humans and designed environments, noted one particular context in which chairs were creatively adapted but ill-suited to their sitters: older adults who spent a lot of their day sitting in La-Z-Boy recliners, watching TV or doing otherwise passive activities.</p><p>They noted that the recliner had even become a makeshift medical treatment chair; they witnessed it being used, for example, in a half-reclined state for people undergoing dialysis treatment. Despite the advantages of its variability in pitch and support structures, however, it was the wrong chair for many of the conditions that come with ageing. Older adults with weakened muscles had trouble getting in and out or reaching the lever for changing positions, and the deep padding, used for its presumed comfort, put people who sat for long periods at risk of bedsores.</p><p>Inspired by the spirit of the recliner, Stumpf and Chadwick reconsidered all of its traditional features and generated a prototype called the Sarah chair , which they pitched to Herman Miller in 1988. It had all the flexibility of a recliner and more – multiple ways to choose the pitch of the back, seat and arms, and a flexible footrest for changing positions more easily. They reduced the padding significantly, making a thinner and more breathable seat structure. The model was popular in-house as a chair with purpose – many Herman Miller staff could imagine it being useful for their grandparents, for example. But the mass-market appeal wasn’t obvious at first, and the firm rejected the Sarah in its first iteration, only to revive the design a few years later.</p><p>For the second version, Stumpf and Chadwick imagined the ergonomic features of the chair with ageing still in mind, but also the body of the average office worker, commonly tethered for long stretches to a personal computer and keyboard. They got rid of the foam padding altogether, making the model’s signature new aesthetic a cushionless seat of thick plastic webbing that would support the shapes of any body, not just an ageing one. The Aeron was a wild success, quickly taken up as a status symbol in high-end office environments like those in Silicon Valley.</p><p>Aeron chairs have become a canonical, if expensive, example of what’s called “universal” design and its variants, barrier-free and inclusive design. This principle is what many people think of when they hear the words “disability” and “design” together. The logic of universalism goes like this: designers gain surprising and powerful insights from looking closely not at norms and averages – not at people whose experiences fall well inside the expected middle of a curve – but instead at people and scenarios at the margins of experience, so-called extreme users. Good designers, the thinking goes, will take a close look at unusual circumstances, places where products (or environments, or services) are full of friction for people with particular needs. There, in the margins of human experience, are clues to suboptimal conditions that may also affect people in the normative middle, though perhaps to a lesser degree.</p><p>In the case of disability, that would mean closely observing older adults and wheelchair users, and people on the autism spectrum, say, and then abstracting from those observations. What is working for these people, and what isn’t, based on what they say or do, or what they don’t say or do? Where might improvements be introduced to address those points of friction at the margins, the places where design isn’t working? After a series of prototypes and testing, the process aims to make a more user-friendly, ergonomic, accessible product (or service, or environment) for all – in principle, at least, design “for everyone”.</p><p>It wasn’t Papanek who offered universal design to the world; it was disabled people whose long-held insights generated what became a set of principles that designers could follow. Ronald Mace, a wheelchair user and architect, is credited with introducing the term “universal design” to the public in 1985. In part, the coinage was strategic, recasting features of design that had been considered “special” as simply good design, resulting in products and buildings that were straightforwardly “usable by all people”.</p><p>The universal design principles that Mace and others in the disability community generated read like an antidote not only to the preoccupation with “styling and obsolescence” that Papanek called out, but also to the “murderous” results of negligent design; they include principles such as “simple and intuitive use”, “perceptible information”, “low physical effort”, and perhaps most important of all, “tolerance for error”.</p><p>Universal design isn’t restricted to high-end items such as the Aeron chair. If you go looking for kitchen tools in your average store, for example, you’ll easily find the Oxo Good Grips line, with the familiar thick black pliable rubber handles that have just enough give to hold comfortably, and just enough sturdy resistance to offer leverage. The brand began with a vegetable peeler, an object so everyday as to be invisible – and that peeler originated, as design often does, in a complaint that inspired an idea.</p><p>In the late 80s, a woman named Betsey Farber was attempting to use a standard metal vegetable peeler in the holiday house she was renting with her husband, Sam, a retired entrepreneur. The tool was frustrating to use, especially because Betsey had arthritis. So, right there in the kitchen, Sam and Betsey started to sketch out ideas for a new version of a peeler. With further refinement, those ideas resulted in the now-ubiquitous Oxo design: fins on the sides elegantly indicate the place to put your thumb in order to optimise the mechanics of use, a visual cue for intuitive handling. When you hold the peeler against a carrot, it encourages you to apply just enough pressure to catch a ribbon of skin without cutting too deeply, and without a reckless amount of slip that would send both carrot and peeler flying from your hands.</p><p>Sam Farber came out of retirement and went to work on the peeler, and the idea that he and Betsey hatched was taken up in a partnership with a product design firm that went on to create the Good Grips line: can openers, salad tongs and other tools made for the subtle work of manual kitchen tasks. Thus went a now-classic universal design success story, which has taken its place in the canon alongside that of the Aeron chair, as inspiration to a generation of would-be practitioners.</p><p>There are other stories besides. Designer Marc Harrison was commissioned by Cuisinart in the late 70s to overhaul its commercial-grade food processor into a more consumer-friendly domestic model. The company didn’t ask Harrison to address disability as a use case for its product, but Harrison’s research and teaching at Rhode Island School of Design had included years of collaborative work on furniture for rehabilitation settings and wheelchair-accessible housing. Those experiences nourished the insights Harrison brought to the processor. He introduced things such as large-print, high-contrast lettering for the labels, and controls that flipped like paddles rather than requiring fiddly turning. These and other features were informed by usability principles Harrison had learned from looking closely at disability. This kind of commitment and imagination in design yields products and experiences that can make life better without you even noticing it.</p><p>Disability is the little-acknowledged heart of the innovation in many digital tools, too. The history of the telephone, for example, is tightly bound up with research on deafness. Alexander Graham Bell’s work with deaf students and their teachers solidified his research on making speech visible, reducible to signals and therefore transmittable by electronic means. That research made telephone technology possible, but it also helped set in motion the standardisation of signal processing that was crucial to early computing.</p><p>In the US, perhaps the most hidden-in-plain-sight of examples of these innovations is the landmark change to media consumption that happened after disability activists fought for closed-captioning technology to be built into every standard television. The Television Decoder Circuitry Act, passed in the US in 1990, required the technology to be a standard part of the television manufacturing process, rather than an extra device attached alongside it. The battle to pass the legislation was difficult and protracted, in the face of resistance from within the communications industry about the perceived extra expense it would entail. But thanks to the economy of scale created by the legislation, the cost of adding this capacity to televisions is now so small that it is almost impossible to calculate. Meanwhile, closed captioning has become a standard feature of daily life. It’s how you follow along with sports matches across a restaurant or airport terminal, and it’s how you understand clips from an election debate on your laptop with the sound off, making it possible to multitask when your kids are in the next room trying to get to sleep.</p><p>It would be easy to conclude from these stories that universal design is dispatching “murderous” objects to the dustbin of history, and that it alone points the way to a more accessible future. Designing ergonomic objects that can be mass-produced and affordable enough to find their way into the hands of people who need them is an unassailable good. But disability scholars also point to the ironies created by the work that Mace and his ilk set in motion. One is that while the dominant model of universal design has disability at its centre, the very success of the innovations it generates tends to obscure their origin stories, as in the case of the Oxo peeler. That success makes many people overlook the barriers that still exist to an adaptive, flexible world for disabled people. Universal design also tends to stoke an unquestioned faith in the importance of products, attained by consumers, as the key to building a desirable world. A better product might be useful in the short term, but sometimes it’s a better process, or a better system, that’s needed to provide a long-term solution.</p><p>Take, for example, the Leveraged Freedom Chair, a design created with paraplegic wheelchair users in parts of the world where accessible streets are rare. Amos Winter, director of the Global Engineering and Research Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), did years of trial-and-error field research with his team in Tanzania, Guatemala and India, in order to collaboratively design a chair with variable torque in driving, even in off-road terrain, using very simple technology. Depending on where you grab one of its extended handles, you get more or less mechanical advantage, just like switching gears on a bicycle, which makes uneven pavement or dirt roads much more navigable. A third wheel in front adds balance. “We failed a number of times,” Winter has said. The design process “has to start and end with end users”, he says. “These are the people who have to define the requirements of the technology, and give it the thumbs-up at the end.”</p><p>Getting the seat, frame and handles in the right positions to be both comfortable and advantageous in their physics was an engineer’s task of very fine designing and building. But the real ingenuity isn’t in the mechanics; it’s in the sustainable system for repair and maintenance. Many wheelchair companies make their chairs with their own proprietary parts, so even if they donate free chairs to people who need them, the parts are expensive to replace, and the chairs become unusable when they break. If a wheelchair is going to last in a rural area among populations who aren’t rich, says Winter, “it has to be repairable using the local tools, materials and knowledge in those contexts”. The Freedom Chair was made of globally standardised and affordable bicycle parts, so they can be repaired and replaced anywhere in the world.</p><p>“To make something cheap and simple and reliable often takes rigorous engineering,” says Winter. “What is the solution that will give you the required performance for as little money and as little complexity as possible?” The Leveraged Freedom Chair was not a compromise; it wasn’t a chair that was “good enough” for the people who use it. It was the right design for specific people in specific contexts, and it was designed to last. </p><p>• Adapted from What Can a Body Do?

Photograph © Tate (CC-BY-NC-ND 3.0).</p><p>It’s the rare story that’s equally familiar to both engineers and literature students: On December 28, 1879, a train was carrying passengers across Scotland’s River Tay from Wormit to Dundee on a very windy evening. The Tay Bridge, which had been completed only a year earlier, spanned some two miles. When it opened, it was the longest railway bridge in the world; the chief engineer was honored for his achievement with a knighthood from Queen Victoria. But this same engineer had neglected to ensure that his construction would withstand particularly heavy gales, and as the train’s six cars reached the center of the bridge’s span, the structure gave way, plunging an estimated seventy-five passengers and crew members into the river’s freezing depths. No one survived.</p><p>The incident made front-page news across Britain. Queen Victoria had a missive sent directly to the lord provost of Dundee: “The queen is inexpressibly shocked, and feels most deeply for those who have lost friends and relatives in this terrible accident.” (Initial reports suggested that the death toll was higher, around two hundred, further compounding the intensity of national emotions.) Despite the carnage, however, the wreck is principally known today as the occasion for one of the English language’s clumsiest poetic efforts, William McGonagall’s “The Tay Bridge Disaster.” Here is one of its infamous stanzas:</p><p>So the train mov’d slowly along the Bridge of Tay,\\n\\t\\tUntil it was about midway,\\n\\t\\tThen the central girders with a crash gave way,\\n\\t\\tAnd down went the train and passengers into the Tay!\\n\\t\\tThe Storm Fiend did loudly bray,\\n\\t\\tBecause ninety lives had been taken away,\\n\\t\\tOn the last Sabbath day of 1879,\\n\\t\\tWhich will be remember’d for a very long time.</p><p>The syntax of the “Disaster” is tortuously arranged to hit the poem’s rhymes; its literalness preempts any possibility for gravitas or emotional weight; and its meter seems beamed in from an alien universe. Undermined by its own technical haplessness, written with the impregnable conviction of the talentless, the “Disaster” is a heartfelt paean to the doomed train passengers that—however ironically and unfortunately—better serves as a memorial to the poet’s own buffoonery.</p><p>Not unjustly, McGonagall is rarely mentioned without an epithet: some version of “the worst poet in the English language.” And by any reasonable account, any judgment based on the most universally shared values of poetics, prosody, and taste, there is little to admire in McGonagall. The rest of his corpus shares—replicates, really—the faults of “The Tay Bridge Disaster”: its lapses into bathos, its involuted syntactical structures, its rhymes so slanted as to be more or less horizontal.</p><p>Photographs from the Tay Bridge inquiry, c. 1886. Commissioned by John Trayner. National Library of Scotland (CC BY 4.0).</p><p>There have been worse poets, of course, and as such it would be more accurate to describe McGonagall as the worst famous poet in the English language, a testament in part to the man’s powers of self-promotion and the caprices of literary history. But McGonagall’s notoriety still owes much to the singularly strange power of his own badness. There’s something, I think, in poems like “The Tay Bridge Disaster”—as well as McGonagall’s many poems on his great themes of death and destruction—that is worth examining; something that might redeem him, ever so slightly, from the annals of amusing semi-obscurity; something unsettling about his ostensibly blinkered artistic vision that might help to account for why he lingers as the patron saint of misbegotten verse.</p><p>Scotland has justifiably claimed him as its own, but in all likelihood McGonagall was born in Ireland, in 1825. His family migrated to Dundee when William was a child, and like much of the city’s population, he grew up to be a weaver. The textile business was booming then, though the apogee of the mechanical revolution wasn’t far behind. And as the industry began to make workers redundant amid its collapse in 1877, McGonagall had a conveniently timed epiphany. Sitting in his room on a spring day, he recalls, “I seemed to feel as it were a strange kind of feeling stealing over me…I imagined that a pen was in my right hand, and a voice crying, ‘Write! Write!’” He complied, writing a graceless tribute to the Scottish preacher George Gilfillan (himself a poet, although the misfortune of having been eulogized by his fellow Dundonian has been the better part of his literary legacy). McGonagall sent the results to Dundee’s Weekly News, where they were subsequently published by a deeply bemused editorial staff.</p><p>What followed over the next two and a half decades was one of the most bizarre careers in Victorian letters. The Weekly News proved a reliable publisher, though it often accompanied McGonagall’s hapless texts with scathingly ironic commentary (a courtesy they were not inclined to extend to their more traditional poetic contributors). Encouraged by what he misconstrued to be rightful artistic recognition, the poet took to local theaters to read his own works and recite Shakespearean soliloquies, whereupon he was often met with raucous crowds who either mockingly encouraged him—sometimes carrying him aloft into the streets—or pelted him with garbage. (Contemporary accounts allege that among the objects he was barraged with were potatoes, footwear, rotten eggs, fish, sacks of soot, peas, snowballs, and, on at least one occasion, a brick.) His profile rising amid these riotous performances, McGonagall increasingly became the victim of a number of cruel pranks, which only served to inflate his own sense of vocational destiny. He trekked to Balmoral Castle seeking an audience with Queen Victoria after someone had passed him a sham letter of patronage; he was tricked into dining with an imposter posing as the dramatist Dion Boucicault; and in the last years of his life, McGonagall was made a knight of the fictional “Holy Order of the White Elephant,” an honor supposedly bestowed upon him by the king of Burma, and of which he proudly and obliviously boasted until his death.</p><p>Another contemporaneous example of bad Tay Bridge poetry, from an unnamed poet. National Library of Scotland (CC BY 4.0).</p><p>Many of McGonagall’s poems, which he churned out at a reliable clip after his poetic conversion, were benign and banal odes to Scottish and English landscapes in the manner of a one-man lyrical tourism bureau. He writes that Crieff, a trendy nineteenth-century vacation spot, “is admirably situated from the cold winter winds / And the visitors, during their stay there, great comfort finds, / Because there is boating and fishing, and admission free, / Therefore they can enjoy themselves right merrily.” What’s more: “There is also golf courses, tennis greens, and good roads, / Which will make the traveling easier to tourists with great loads.” The specificity of McGonagall’s laundry list of amenities is at every point undermined, in his typical manner, by a penchant for recycling some wonderfully ungainly idioms. Parts of Montrose in “Bonnie Montrose,” for instance, are “most magnificent to be seen,” “most charming to be seen,” and “most beautiful to see,” in three successive stanzas. Even with their regional particularity, the poems feel perfectly interchangeable. The poem’s titles often do the work of announcing the sameness of their portrayals: “Bonnie Kilmany” and “Bonnie Callander,” “Beautiful North Berwick” and “Beautiful Village of Penicuik.”</p><p>Despite a penchant for the versified guidebook, however, the principal thematic fixture of McGonagall’s career was cataclysm. “The Tay Bridge Disaster” was only the inaugurating work in a long series of calamity chronicles. It seems as if the poet never met a catastrophe that he didn’t contrive to transform into misguided elegy. Shipwrecks were his forte, but any disaster would do, really. He memorialized the victims of fires, tornadoes, stampedes, floods, military routs, any mass-casualty event that would have found its way into the Dundee press. According to Norman Watson, McGonagall’s biographer, out of the 270 poems attributed to McGonagall, twelve are on funerals, six on fires, fifty on battles, and twenty-four on “maritime disasters.” The poems’ rote, straightforward titles compose a global charnel house of grisly incident: “The Terrific Cyclone of 1893,” “The Pennsylvania Disaster,” “The Horrors of Majuba,” “The Wreck of the Steamer ‘Stella,’ ” “The Great Yellow River Inundation in China.”</p><p>While remaining true to the general principles of McGonagallian style, these poems carried with them their own particular formal and phrasal tics. “The Pennsylvania Disaster,” written to commemorate the Johnstown Flood, is a useful case in point. The poem opens with a kind of dateline: “’Twas in the year of 1889, and in the month of June, / Ten thousand people met with a fearful doom.” The death count established, the reader adequately oriented in historical time, McGonagall moves on to narrate the horrors of the flood in his characteristic tragic mode: comically flattened affect punctuated by mannered exclamations of grief.</p><p>Oh, heaven! it was a pitiful and a most agonizing sight,\\n\\t\\tTo see parents struggling hard with all their might,\\n\\t\\tTo save their little ones from being drowned,\\n\\t\\tBut ’twas vain, the mighty flood engulfed them, with a roaring sound.</p><p>In the end, virtually all of his poems conclude with the assertion that these events “will never be forgot,” or “will be remember’d for a very long time,” manifesting a certain (and ultimately, somehow, warranted) confidence about the afterlife of his verse itself. But in poems like “The Pennsylvania Disaster,” McGonagall also tends to fixate on more particular, character-driven vignettes—a husband and wife lifting a dead child from a burning cradle, an orphaned “beautiful girl, the belle of Johnstown” staring into the torrent of water in which her parents had just drowned, a heroic telegraph operator wiring messages until the bitter end—that often derive from contemporary accounts.</p><p>For that reason, Watson and other critics have contended that McGonagall’s poetry might be considered a kind of nineteenth-century news broadcast. It’s a neat way of making sense of these poems’ strangeness—their fixation on specificity of number, time, and place might be McGonagall’s way of incorporating or transforming the generic markers of “news” into literature. His plodding couplets constitute a kind of doleful formal grid onto which any instance of horror can easily be installed, not unlike the strictures of an Associated Press dispatch or evening news segment. But I found myself wondering if his disaster poetry might be less a dramatization of the news than a staging of its consumption.</p><p>The most recognizable elements of his poems—the banal repetitiveness (both across individual works and within them), the recourse to platitude and bromide, the obsession with quantification and particularity—it all bears the contemporary hallmarks of the experience of news. Prior to this year, it was most familiar with regard to mass shootings—the obsessive tracking of the escalating death count; the offerings of hackneyed “thoughts and prayers,” followed by the complaints that have become their own benumbing clichés; the avowals that it will never happen again, supplemented by reassurances that it will be “remembered for a very long time.” Any disaster, in this way, is both devastatingly unique and inevitably iterative.</p><p>Mexican News, by Alfred Jones, after Richard Caton Woodville, 1851. Smithsonian American Art Museum, gift of Mr. and Mrs. Donald F. Fenn, 1976.</p><p>This year we’ve been introduced to the same phenomenon on a far more deadly scale than McGonagall’s most ghastly memorials could have accounted for. But the plot of this infectious disaster still follows the standard arc of his poems, drifting inexorably from particularity toward abstraction and thus detachment, as the Covid-19 death toll in the United States reached five, then six figures. In this sense, McGonagall’s poetry feels eerily familiar, not unlike reading a versified front page of the New York Times. All that’s left to do is count the dead, mourn predictably, and await the next catastrophe, until the dimly recalled horrors of Covid-19 feel as distant as the litany of nineteenth-century disasters toward which McGonagall’s poetry endlessly gravitated.</p><p>The final years of McGonagall’s life, like his poems’ metrical schemas, were a set of frustrated expectations. He had thus far managed to eke out a piddling living through his live performances and the pecuniary kindness of certain acquaintances, but by the end of the nineteenth century he had been banned from most public performances in Dundee. Imposters sent imitations of his work to the local newspapers, one of his sons was accused of breaking the ribs of a local ropemaker, and another was placed in an asylum. The aging poet could hardly leave his home without being ridiculed on the streets with a vehemence that verged on assault. More or less destitute, he took on a few commercial jobs, producing verses in celebration of Sunlight soap and Beecham’s Pills, a laxative.1 When McGonagall died of a brain hemorrhage in 1902, his death certificate misspelled his name.</p><p>McGonagall faded from the public’s imagination for several decades, but the inevitable cult gradually began to coalesce. Appreciation societies were formed, plaques were erected, Dundee and Edinburgh squabbled over who deserved to claim McGonagall as a native son. A 1974 film, The Great McGonagall, starred one of the poet’s biggest boosters, the comedian Spike Milligan, in the title role. (It was a flop, and featured an incongruous nude scene inserted at the insistence of the film’s producer, a noted pornographer.) More recently, J.K. Rowling’s Professor Minerva McGonagall was named for the poet, the belabored joke being the apparent vast intellectual gulf between the clueless William and Greek mythology’s sage Minerva.</p><p>One school of thought still wonders whether or not McGonagall was the genuine rube that he often seems; whether there was a subtle careerism at play, even a knowing hucksterism; and whether he might have been perfectly willing to play to his audience’s expectations for a meager income in desperate times. It’s a theory that could partly explain his fixation on national tragedy: What better way to elevate himself above his provincial status than to garner notice by casting himself as national bard? As poetic town crier on a countrywide scale?</p><p>This is likely an irresolvable question, and any honest account of McGonagall’s career has to settle somewhere in between these two poles—assuming that the poet was aware of the joke if never entirely in on it (by the end of his life, McGonagall’s card identified himself as both a poet and a comedian). But to regard him chiefly as a fool, to laugh at him from a comfortable historical distance, is to ignore the ways in which his disaster poetry, in all its maladroit amateurism, can make contemporary readers uncomfortable, sensitive to the distance, even the callousness, with which the unimaginable must be confronted.</p><p>McGonagall’s poems seem to mark the point at which language fails to adequately respond to a kind of loss that is, perhaps literally, unimaginable. Its desperate recourse is the jumbled McGonagallisms for which the poet is known but with which we’re all familiar as a way of processing tragedy.

Whole books of moody photographic studies of concrete buildings are snapped up by fans of urban life and retro design. A crop of new books explores the Brutalism of socialist states.</p><p>While Constructivism and avant-gardism in fine art came to prominence during the October Revolution, it was suppressed in favour of Socialist Realism by the mid-1930s. In architecture more adventurous forms and materials persisted, although in the minority. Under Stalin there was a degree of stylistic conformity and austerity, yet adventurous architecture was not seen as “bourgeois formalism” as it was in art. Following the death of Stalin in 1953, historicism receded and a greater variety of art, design and architecture (including Modernist architecture) became possible.</p><p>While supposedly for the masses, many of the showpiece constructions were moribund from the start: inverted ziggurat hotels that were barely occupied and shopping centres with few consumer goods to offer. Much of this architecture was completed less than a decade before the economic and political collapse of the Eastern Bloc.</p><p>In postcards, gargantuan apartment buildings — veritable terrestrial ocean liners — tower over public spaces, making miniatures of two-tone buses and Trabants. Third-Worldism (also called the Non-Aligned Movement) was a political position of the mid-century decades that apparently offered advantages of alliance to states that pledged to remain equidistant between socialism and democratic capitalism. In practice, most post-colonial states in Africa, South America and South Asia following Third-Worldism did turn to the two superpowers, which provided strategic assistance in return for favourable trading status or military co-operation, thus forming indirect and unstated alliances rather than outright ones.</p><p>Consumer Culture: Landscapes in Socialist Yugoslavia presents the architecture of a state that blended one-party socialism and the market economy. Consequently, its material standard of living was better than Eastern Bloc states. This book includes contributions addressing various aspects of Yugoslavia’s architectural heritage in Split, Sarajevo, Novi Sad and Pristina.</p><p>East German Modern is a photographic essay on Modernist buildings of the GDR. An introduction is followed by many new photographs of the buildings as they are now. Some are still exciting and distinctive — though somewhat impractical — structures. Others are graffiti-daubed, cracking eyesores that are doubtless due for demolition before long. There is a deep melancholy about these relics of an impossible dream marooned in an economically straitened region suffering from emigration and loss of confidence.</p><p>If these cinemas and piazzas ever thronged on summer evenings, they no longer do so. Windows are broken, moss girts precast walls and grass grows between paving stones. With operating costs no longer absorbed by the state, GDR buildings are expensive, inefficient white elephants. The GDR style of modular Plattenbau with precast concrete elements is one that neither traditionalists nor fans of Brutalism admire. In 40 years’ time no one will be lobbying for its preservation.</p><p>Imagine Moscow outlines how Soviet Man and Woman were to be made efficient, their lives regulated to the minute. Meals would be communal, unmarried individuals sleep in dormitories, married couples be afforded some privacy, children be separated from family members, sport and hobbies be organised group activities, with privacy abolished.</p><p>Efficiencies of scale could be applied to industrialise and communise all aspects of existence. Some of these stipulations were put into practice piecemeal but others proved too complicated, costly or disagreeable. Architecture (including urban planning and public transport) was to be key to developing humanity’s collective potential through social engineering.</p><p>In the 1920s, the only limits were imagination. Concepts were developed for mega-skyscrapers, artificial urban panoramas and floating cities supported by colossal columns. Meanwhile, families were living in corridors of dilapidated expropriated townhouses. Imagine Moscow outlines the interface between Suprematist art and city planning, and Constructivist avant-garde architecture in those heady post-Revolution years when mankind seemed poised to take a great leap forward.</p><p>The universalism of socialist idealism was manifest in the shared use of motifs and theories in fabrics, ceramics, clothing, furniture, architecture and street plans produced in this time. Imagine Moscow includes examples of these plus the photographs, posters, projections and plans that accompanied them.</p><p>The megalomaniacal overreach beloved of dictators and architects reached its apotheosis in 1920s Moscow. This reveals the millenarian religious character of socialism; Soviet advocates often talked in cosmic terms, envisaging the earthly paradises of the proletariat expiating sins of class, capitalism and colonialism. Yet just as notions of Soviet Man foundered upon human nature, so plans for utopian buildings were undone by their essential impracticality.</p><p>There was a plan to move the Pushkin Museum by jacking it up, feeding rollers underneath and dragging it away. The Palace of the Soviets — a mega-skyscraper intended to symbolically supplant the skyscrapers of capitalist New York — was defeated by geology and war. The pinnacle to this tapering wedding-cake montage of a building would have been a 100-metre statue of Lenin.</p><p>Of these books, Soviet Metro Stations is the most purely pleasurable. Most of the stations portrayed are in excellent condition, maintained as expected, undefiled by posters and graffiti.</p><p>The underground networks of major cities around the USSR were one of the unchallenged glories of the Soviet system, excepting the forced labour that was used to construct the earliest infrastructure. In a state with harsh winters, the underground was an efficient transport system, unconstrained by restrictive planning permissions and consultation. The construction of the Moscow metro commenced in the 1930s. The first line opened in 1935.</p><p>Although Soviet Metro Stations is primarily a photographic book, a short but comprehensive introduction details the development, design and history of the various metros in the former USSR. Photographs document the stations of Yerevan, Kharkov, Kiev, Novosibirsk, Tashkent and other cities. Stations were to be palaces of the people. This was not a vain boast. The stations were airy, well-lit and dignified. Décor ranged from the futuristic (pressed geometric metal panels) to the palatial. Other styles adopted were Art Deco, Asiatic and ancient Egyptian. Some stations look eerily similar to the moon bases and space stations found in sci-fi films.</p><p>The de-communisation of Ukraine has meant that Soviet names and artwork on the Kiev metro has been replaced with advertising — a loss to both travellers and design enthusiasts. The single-span vaults with island platforms in the Kharkov metro became emulated designs. With light-coloured geodesic tiling, these bright halls are like glittering ice caverns. Happily, the Kharkov metro has escaped the de-communisation that disfigured Kiev.</p><p>Architecture in Global Socialism covers the outposts of socialism in the Middle East and Africa, the zone of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Global South. In the post-colonial era, nascent countries required the trappings and infrastructure of states: bridges, dams, airports, parliaments, museums, ministries and sports stadiums. The author points out that socialist countries possessed an ideological antipathy towards imperialism and therefore had a fraternal impetus to ally themselves with newly independent nations of the Middle East and Africa. The Iraqi-Syrian Ba’ath parties, Ghana’s Kwame Nkrumah, Uganda’s Idi Amin and Indonesia’s Sukarno incorporated aspects of socialism into their platforms.</p><p>In return for the export of services of architects and technicians for construction projects — and associated credit lines — the socialist nations gained access to favourable trading agreements for raw materials such as rubber, timber, cotton, metals, oil and food. Concomitant soft power of diplomatic, cultural and military ties advanced the interests of both states. These relationships were very complex, multi-layered and rapidly shifting, especially considering the numerous coups and revolutions of post-colonial countries.</p><p>Much of Abu Dhabi’s first-phase state infrastructure was designed and built by Bulgarians, Iraq employed architectural firms from the Eastern Bloc, and Hungarian architects worked in Ghana. Architecture in Global Socialism strikes a generally successful balance between theoretical exposition and historical analysis, liberally illustrated, suitably informed but accessible to the general reader.</p>\",\"date\":\"2020-8-24\",\"link\":\"https://thecritic.co.uk/melancholy-of-obsolete-futures/\",\"discrp\":\"The apotheosis of Brutalism, that megalomaniacal overreach beloved of architects and dictators, was in 1920s Moscow.

She is the author of Complexity: A Guided Tour (2009) and Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans (2019).</p><p>We’re at a unique moment in the 200,000 years or so that Homo sapiens have walked the Earth. For the first time in that long history, humans are capable of coordinating on a global scale, using fine-grained data on individual behaviour, to design robust and adaptable social systems. The pandemic of 2019-20 has brought home this potential. Never before has there been a collective, empirically informed response of the magnitude that COVID-19 has demanded. Yes, the response has been ambivalent, uneven and chaotic – we are fumbling in low light, but it’s the low light of dawn.</p><p>At this historical juncture, we should acknowledge and exploit the fact we live in a complex system – a system with many interacting agents, whose collective behaviour is usually hard to predict. Understanding the key properties of complex systems can help us clarify and deal with many new and existing global challenges, from pandemics to poverty and ecological collapse. </p><p>In complex systems, the last thing that happened is almost never informative about what’s coming next. The world is always changing – partly due to factors outside our control and partly due to our own interventions. In the final pages of his novel One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967), Gabriel García Márquez highlights the paradox of how human agency at once enables and interferes with our capacity to predict the future, when he describes one of the characters translating a significant manuscript:</p><p>Our world is not so different from the vertiginous fantasies of Márquez – and the linear thinking of simple cause-effect reasoning, to which the human mind can default, is not a good policy tool. Instead, living in a complex system requires us to embrace and even harness uncertainty. Instead of attempting to narrowly forecast and control outcomes, we need to design systems that are robust and adaptable enough to weather a wide range of possible futures.</p><p>Think of hundreds of fireflies flashing together on a summer’s evening. How does that happen? A firefly’s decision to flash is thought to depend on the flashing of its neighbours. Depending on the copying rule they’re using, this coordination causes the group to synchronise in either a ‘bursty’ or ‘snappy’ fashion. In her book Patterns of Culture (1934), the anthropologist Ruth Benedict argued that each part of a social system depends on its other parts in circuitous ways. Not only are such systems nonlinear – the whole is more than the sum of the parts – but the behaviour of the parts themselves depends on the behaviour of the whole.</p><p>Like swarms of fireflies, all human societies are collective and coupled. Collective, meaning it is our combined behaviour that gives rise to society-wide effects. Coupled, in that our perceptions and behaviour depend on the perceptions and behaviour of others, and on the social and economic structures we collectively build. As consumers, we note a shortage of toilet paper at the supermarket, so we hoard it, and then milk, eggs and flour, too. We see our neighbours wearing masks, so put on a mask as well. Traders in markets panic upon perceiving a downward trend, follow the herd and, to echo Márquez, end up causing the precipitous drop they fear.</p><p>These examples capture how the collective results of our actions feed back, in both virtuous and vicious circles, to affect the system in its entirety – reinforcing or changing the patterns we initially perceived, often in nonobvious ways. For instance, some coronavirus contact-tracing apps can inform users of the locations of infected persons so they can be avoided. This kind of coupling between local behaviour and society-wide information is appealing because it seems to simplify decision-making for busy individuals. Yet we know from many years of work on swarming and synchronicity – think of the flashing fireflies – that the dynamics of coupled systems can be surprising.</p><p>A recent study in Nature Physics found transitions to orderly states such as schooling in fish (all fish swimming in the same direction) can be caused, paradoxically, by randomness, or ‘noise’ feeding back on itself. That is, a misalignment among the fish causes further misalignment, eventually inducing a transition to schooling. Most of us wouldn’t guess noise can produce predictable behaviour. The result invites us to consider how technology such as contact-tracing apps, although informing us locally, might negatively impact our collective movement. If each of us changes our behaviour to avoid the infected, we might generate a collective pattern we had aimed to avoid: higher levels of interaction between the infected and susceptible, or high levels of interaction among the asymptomatic.</p><p>Complex systems also suffer from a special vulnerability to events that don’t follow a normal distribution or ‘bell curve’. When events are distributed normally, most outcomes are familiar and don’t seem particularly striking. Height is a good example: it’s pretty unusual for a man to be over 7 feet tall; most adults are between 5 and 6 feet, and there is no known person over 9 feet tall. But in collective settings where contagion shapes behaviour – a run on the banks, a scramble to buy toilet paper – the probability distributions for possible events are often heavy-tailed. There is a much higher probability of extreme events, such as a stock market crash or a massive surge in infections. These events are still unlikely, but they occur more frequently and are larger than would be expected under normal distributions.</p><p>What’s more, once a rare but hugely significant ‘tail’ event takes place, this raises the probability of further tail events. We might call them second-order tail events; they include stock market gyrations after a big fall, and earthquake aftershocks. The initial probability of second-order tail events is so tiny it’s almost impossible to calculate – but once a first-order tail event occurs, the rules change, and the probability of a second-order tail event increases.</p><p>The dynamics of tail events are complicated by the fact they result from cascades of other unlikely events. When COVID-19 first struck, the stock market suffered stunning losses followed by an equally stunning recovery. Some of these dynamics are potentially attributable to former sports bettors, with no sports to bet on, entering the market as speculators rather than investors. The arrival of these new players might have increased inefficiencies, and allowed savvy long-term investors to gain an edge over bettors with different goals. In a different context, we might eventually see the explosive growth of Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 as an example of a third-order tail event: a ‘black swan’, precipitated by the killing of George Floyd, but primed by a virus that disproportionately affected the Black community in the United States, a recession, a lockdown and widespread frustration with a void of political leadership. The statistician and former financier Nassim Nicholas Taleb has argued that black swans can have a disproportionate role in how history plays out – perhaps in part because of their magnitude, and in part because their improbability means we are rarely prepared to handle them.</p><p>One reason a first-order tail event can induce further tail events is that it changes the perceived costs of our actions, and change the rules that we play by. This game-change is an example of another key complex systems concept: nonstationarity. A second, canonical example of nonstationarity is adaptation, as illustrated by the arms race involved in the coevolution of hosts and parasites. Like the Red Queen and Alice in Alice in Wonderland, parasite and host each has to ‘run’ faster, just to keep up with the novel solutions the other one presents as they battle it out in evolutionary time.</p><p>Learning changes an agent’s behaviour, which in turn changes the behaviour of the system. Take a firm that fudges its numbers on quarterly earnings reports, or a high-school student who spends all her time studying specifically for a college-entrance exam rather than developing the analytical skills the test is supposed to be measuring. In these examples, a metric is introduced as a proxy for ability. Individuals in the system come to associate performance on these metrics with shareholder happiness or getting into college. As this happens, the metric becomes a target to be gamed, and as such ceases to be an objective measure of what it is purporting to assess. This is known as Goodhart’s Law, summarised by the business adage: ‘The worst thing that can happen to you is to meet your targets.’</p><p>Another type of nonstationarity relates to a concept we call information flux. The system might not be changing, but the amount of information we have about it is. While learning concerns the way we use the information available, information flux relates to the quality of the data we use to learn. At the beginning of the pandemic, for example, there was a dramatic range of estimates of the asymptomatic transmission rate. This variation partly came from learning how to make a good model of the COVID-19 contagion, but it was also due to information flux caused by the fact that viruses spread, and so early on only a small number of people are infected. This makes for sparse data on the numbers of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, not to mention the number of people exposed. Early on, noise in the data tends to overwhelm the signal, making learning very difficult indeed.</p><p>These forms of nonstationarity mean biological and social systems will be ‘out of equilibrium’, as it’s known in the physics and complex systems literature. One of the biggest hazards of living in an out-of-equilibrium system is that even interventions informed by data and modelling can have unintended consequences. Consider government efforts to enforce social distancing to flatten the COVID-19 infection curve. Although social distancing has been crucial in slowing the infection rate and helping to avoid overwhelming hospitals, the strategy has created a slew of second- and third-order biological, sociological and economic effects. Among them are massive unemployment, lost profit, market instability, mental health issues, increase in domestic violence, social shaming, neglect of other urgent problems such as climate change and, perhaps most importantly, second-order interventions such as the reserve banks injecting liquidity into the markets, governments passing massive stimulus bills to shore up economies, and possible changes to privacy laws to accommodate the need to enforce social distancing and perform contact-tracing.</p><p>Do the properties of complex systems mean prediction and control are hopeless enterprises? They certainly make prediction hard, and favour scenario planning for multiple eventualities instead of forecasting the most likely ones. But an inability to predict the future doesn’t preclude the possibility of security and quality of life. Nature, after all, is full of collective, coupled systems with the same properties of nonlinearity and nonstationarity. We should therefore look to the way biological systems cope, adapt and even thrive under such conditions. </p><p>Before we turn to nature, a few remarks about human engineering. Our species has been attempting to engineer social and ecological outcomes since the onset of cultural history. That can work well when the engineering is iterative, ‘bottom up’ and takes place over a long time. But many such interventions have been impotent or, worse, disastrous, as discussed by the anthropologist Steve Lansing in his book Priests and Programmers: Technologies of Power in the Engineered Landscape of Bali (2007). In one section, Lansing compares the effective, 1,000-year-old local water distribution system in Bali with the one imposed by central government engineers during the 20th-century green revolution. This top-down approach disrupted the fragile island and its shoreline ecosystems, and undermined collective governance.</p><p>Fiascos happen when we use crude data to make qualitative decisions. Other reasons include facile understandings of cause and effect, and the assumption that the past contains the best information about the future. This kind of ‘backward looking’ prediction, with a narrow focus on the last ‘bad’ event, leaves us vulnerable to perceptual blindness. Take how the US responded to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 by investing heavily in terrorism prevention, at the expense of other problems such as healthcare, education and global poverty. Likewise, during the COVID-19 crisis, a deluge of commentators has stressed investment in healthcare as the key issue. Healthcare is neglected and important, as the pandemic has made clear – but to put it at the centre of our efforts is to again be controlled by the past. </p><p>Fans of The Lord of the Rings might remember the character Aragorn’s plan to draw Sauron’s eye to the Black Gate, so that the protagonists Frodo and Sam could slip into Sauron’s realm via another route (the lair of a terrifying spider-like monster). The plan relied on Sauron’s fear of the past, when Aragorn’s ancestor cut the powerful ring at the centre of the story from Sauron’s finger. The point is that narrow, emotionally laden focus effectively prevents us from perceiving other problems even when they are developing right under our noses. In complex systems, it is critical to build safeguards against this tendency – which, on a light-hearted note, we name Sauron’s bias.</p><p>There are better ways to make consequential, society-wide decisions. As the mathematician John Allen Paulos remarked about complex systems: ‘Uncertainty is the only certainty there is. And knowing how to live with insecurity is the only security.’ Instead of prioritising outcomes based on the last bad thing that happened – applying laser focus to terrorism or inequality, or putting vast resources into healthcare – we might take inspiration from complex systems in nature and design processes that foster adaptability and robustness for a range of scenarios that could come to pass.</p><p>This approach has been called emergent engineering. It’s profoundly different from traditional engineering, which is dominated by forecasting, trying to control the behaviour of a system and designing it to achieve specific outcomes. By contrast, emergent engineering embraces uncertainty as a fact of life that’s potentially constructive.</p><p>When applied to society-wide challenges, emergent engineering yields a different kind of problem-solving. Under a policy of constructive uncertainty, for example, individuals might be guaranteed a high minimum quality of life, but wouldn’t be guaranteed social structures or institutions in any particular form. Instead, economic, social and other systems would be designed so that they can switch states fluidly, as context demands. This would require a careful balancing act between questions of what’s good and right on the one hand – fairness, equality, equal opportunity – and a commitment to robustness and adaptability on the other. It is a provocative proposal, and experimenting with it, even on a relatively small scale as in healthcare or financial market design, will require wading through a quagmire of philosophical, ethical and technical issues. Yet nature’s success suggests it has potential.</p><p>The human heart confers robustness by beating to a rhythm that’s neither chaotic nor periodic but fractal</p><p>Consider that the human body is remarkably functional given all that could go wrong with its approximately 30 trillion cells (and 38 trillion bacterial cells in the body’s microbiome). Nature keeps things working with two broad classes of strategy. The first ensures that a system will continue to function in the face of disturbances or ‘perturbations’; the second enables a system to reduce uncertainty but allow for change, by letting processes proceed at different timescales.</p><p>The first strategy relies on what are known as robustness mechanisms. They allow systems to continue to operate smoothly even when perturbations damage key components. For example, gene expression patterns are said to be robust if they do not vary in the face of environmental or genetic perturbations such as mutations. There are many mechanisms that make this invariance possible, and much debate about how they work, but we can simplify here to give the basic idea. One example is shadow enhancers: partially redundant DNA sequences that regulate genes and work together to keep gene expression stable when a mutation occurs. Another example is gene duplication in which genes have a backup copy with partial functional overlap. This redundancy can allow the duplicate to compensate if the original gene is damaged.</p><p>Robustness mechanisms can be challenging to build in both natural and engineered systems, because their utility isn’t obvious until something goes wrong. They require anticipating the character of rare but damaging perturbations. Nature nonetheless has discovered a rich repertoire of robustness mechanisms. Reconciliation – making up after fights and restoring relationships to a preconflict baseline – isn’t just a human invention. It’s common throughout the animal kingdom and has been observed in many different species. In a different context, the complex structure of the human heart is thought to confer robustness to perturbations at a wide range of scales by beating to a rhythm that is neither chaotic nor periodic but has a fractal structure. Robust design, in contrast to typical approaches in engineering, focuses on discovering mechanisms that maintain functionality under changing or uncertain environments.</p><p>Nature has another set of tricks up her sleeve. The timescales on which a system’s processes run have critical consequences for its ability to predict and adapt to the future. Prediction is easier when things change slowly – but if things change too slowly, it becomes hard to innovate and respond to change. To solve this paradox, nature builds systems that operate on multiple timescales. Genes change relatively slowly but gene expression is fast. The outcomes of fights in a monkey group change daily but their power structure takes months or years to change. Fast timescales – monkey fights – have more uncertainty, and consequently provide a mechanism for social mobility. Meanwhile, slow timescales – power structures – provide consistency and predictability, allowing individuals to figure out the regularities and develop appropriate strategies.</p><p>The degree of timescale separation between fast and slow dynamics matters too. If there’s a big separation and the power structure changes very slowly, no amount of fight-winning will get a young monkey to the top – even if that monkey, as it gained experience, became a really gifted fighter. A big separation means it will take a long time for ‘real’ information at the individual level – eg, that the young monkey has become a good fighter – to be reflected in the power structure. Hence, if the power structure changes too slowly, although it might guard against meaningless changes at the individual level, it won’t be informative about regularities – about who can actually successfully use force when things, such as the ability of our young monkey, really do change.</p><p>Furthermore, sometimes the environment requires the system as a whole to innovate, but sometimes it demands quiescence. That means there’s a benefit to being able to adjust the degree of timescale separation between the fast and slow processes, depending on whether it’s useful for a change at the ‘bottom’ to be felt at the ‘top’. These points circle us back to our earlier remarks about nonstationarity – the degree of timescale separation is a way of balancing trade-offs caused by different types of nonstationarity in the system.</p><p>The detailed mechanisms by which nature accomplishes timescale separation are still largely unknown and an active area of scientific investigation. However, humans can still take inspiration from the timescale-separation idea. When we design systems of the future, we could build in mechanisms that enable users – such as market engineers and policymakers – to tune the degree of timescale separation or coupling between individual behaviour on the one hand, and institutions or aggregate variables such as stock returns or time in elected office on the other. We have crude versions of this already. Financial markets are vulnerable to crashes because of an inherent lack of timescale separation between trading and stock market indices, such that it’s possible in periods of panic-selling for an index to lose substantial value in a matter of hours. In recognition of this property, market engineers introduced what’s called a ‘circuit breaker’ – a rule for pausing trading when signs of a massive drop are detected. The circuit breaker doesn’t really tune the separation between trades and index performance, though. It simply halts trading when a crash seems likely. A more explicit tuning approach would be to slow down trading during dangerous periods by limiting the magnitude or frequency of trades in a given window, and to allow trading to proceed at will when the environment is more predictable. There are many possible alternative tuning mechanisms; which is best suited to markets is ultimately an empirical question.</p><p>Stock market crashes are a bridge to another of nature’s fascinating properties: the presence of tipping points or critical points, as they’re called in physics. When a system ‘sits’ near a critical point, a small shock can cause a big shift. Sometimes, this means a shift into a new state – a group of fish shoaling (weakly aligned) detects a shark (the shock) and switches to a school formation (highly aligned), which is good for speedy swimming and confusing the predator. These tipping points are often presented in popular articles as something to avoid, for example, when it comes to climate change. But, in fact, as the shark example illustrates, sitting near a critical point can allow a system to adapt appropriately if the environment changes.</p><p>As with timescale separation, tipping points can be useful design features – if distance from them can be modulated. For example, in a recent study of a large, captive monkey society it was found the social system was near a critical point such that a small rise in agitation – perhaps caused by a hot afternoon – could set off a cascade of aggression that would nudge the group from a peaceful state into one in which everyone is fighting. In this group there happened to be powerful individuals who policed conflict, breaking up fights impartially. By increasing or decreasing their frequency of intervention, these individuals could be tuning the group’s sensitivity to perturbations – how far the aggression cascades travel – and thereby tuning distance from the critical point.</p><p>We still don’t know how widespread this sort of tuning is in biological systems. But like degree of timescale separation, it’s something we can build into human systems to make them more fluid and adaptive – and therefore better able to respond to volatility and shocks. In the case of healthcare, that might mean having the financial and technological capacity to build and dismantle temporary treatment facilities at a moment’s notice, perhaps using 3D-printed equipment and biodegradable or reusable materials. In the economy, market corrections that burst bubbles before they get too large serve this function to some extent – they dissipate energy that has built up within the system, but keep the cascade small enough that the market isn’t forced into a crash.</p><p>Climate-change activists warning about tipping points are right to worry. Problems arise when the distance from the critical point can’t be tuned, when individuals make errors (such as incorrectly thinking a shark is present), and when there’s no resilience in the system – that is, no way back to an adaptive state after a system has been disturbed. Irreversible perturbations can lead to complete reconfigurations or total system failure. Reconfiguration might be necessary if the environment has changed, but it will likely involve a costly transition, in that the system will need time and resources to find satisfactory solutions to the new environment. When the world is moderately or very noisy – filled with random, uninformative events – sensitivity to perturbations is dangerous. But it’s useful when a strategic shift is warranted (eg, a predator appears) or when the environment is fundamentally changing and the old tactics simply won’t do.</p><p>One of the many challenges in designing systems that flourish under uncertainty is how to improve the quality of information available in the system. We are not perfect information processors. We make mistakes and have a partial, incomplete view of the world. The same is true of markets, as the investor Bill Miller has pointed out. This lack of individual omniscience can have positive and negative effects. From the system’s point of view, many windows on the world affords multiple independent (or semi-independent) assessments of the environment that provide a form of ‘collective intelligence’. However, each individual would also like a complete view, and so is motivated to copy, share and steal information from others. Copying and observation can facilitate individual learning, but at the same time tends to reduce the independence and diversity that’s valuable for the group as a whole. A commonly cited example is the so-called herd mentality of traders who, in seeing others sell, panic and sell their own shares.</p><p>For emergent engineering to succeed, we need to develop a better understanding of what makes a group intelligent. What we do know is there seem to be two phases or parts of the process – the accumulation phase, in which individuals collect information about how the world works, and the aggregation phase, in which that information is pooled. We also know that if individuals are bad at collecting good information – if they misinterpret data due to their own biases or are overconfident in their assessments – an aggregation mechanism can compensate.</p><p>One example of an aggregation mechanism is the PageRank algorithm used early on in Google searches. PageRank worked by giving more weight to those pages that have many incoming connections from other webpages. Another kind of aggregation mechanism might discount votes of individuals who are prone to come to the same conclusion because they use the same reasoning process, thereby undermining diversity. Or take the US electoral college, which was originally conceived to ‘correct’ the popular vote so that population-dense areas didn’t entirely control election outcomes. If, on the other hand, implementing or identifying good aggregation mechanisms is hard – there are, for example, many good arguments against the electoral college – it might be possible to compensate by investing in improving the information-accumulation capacity of individuals. That way, common cognitive biases such as overconfidence, anchoring and loss-aversion are less likely at first instance. That said, in thinking through how to design aggregation algorithms that optimise for collective intelligence, ethical issues concerning privacy and fairness also present themselves.</p><p>Rather than attempt to precisely predict the future, we have tried to make the case for designing systems that favour robustness and adaptability – systems that can be creative and responsive when faced with an array of possible scenarios. The COVID-19 pandemic provides an unprecedented opportunity to begin to think through how we might harness collective behaviour and uncertainty to shape a better future for us all.

But in Donald Hall’s case, his decades-long relationship with his assistant proved to be a lifeline that extended his writing career.</p><p>When Donald Hall interviewed Kendel Currier for the part-time job of typing his correspondence in August of 1994, one of the first things he asked was, “Will you type curse words?” His earlier hire for the position, a woman active in a local church, backed out when she discovered curse words in a letter, and he wanted to make sure Currier wouldn’t quit, too.</p><p>Hall found Currier’s response reassuring: She would type whatever he dictated, she told him, and keep a dictionary nearby in case she was uncertain of a spelling. She was thirty-six at the time and, by her own description, a stay-at-home mom and housewife. But she’d done secretarial work in the past, and Hall—not quite twice Currier’s age at sixty-six—was impressed by her professionalism. So, he hired her on the spot, and turned up the next day at her house in Andover, New Hampshire, with a canvas bag that contained a model letter, a stack of stationery, and a transcriber for playing back the dictation on his tapes. “It was as if the universe offered me a gift,” Currier later said, “and I was smart enough to accept it.”</p><p>Currier obtained the typewriter she used, an IBM Selectric III, from Hall’s previous typist, Lois Fierro. Lois also offered Currier a couple of tips: Hall insisted on the British spelling “cheque” for a bank check, and spelled “anymore” as two words.</p><p>Soon Hall and his amanuensis fell into their daily rhythm: he drove ten miles to her home in Andover to drop off the tape she was to transcribe with a guide sheet, and she typed up letters for the next day, when he brought her another tape. Because they used two briefcases for their transactions, the two rarely spoke. She would leave her briefcase with its finished work between her storm and front doors, where he could easily exchange it with his briefcase containing new work. Hall came early in the morning, and often, when Currier opened the door, he’d have already come and gone. In a way, she says, “we took up our own correspondence, I typing notes to him, and he answering me on the daily tape.”</p><p>The voice she found on the tapes was hard to get used to at first. “He was a man I didn’t know, and I had to learn how to hear him,” she says. “And there was a lot of background noise, because he often dictated while he was watching a baseball game or driving his car.” But she was immediately impressed by the recipients of his letters. “The first letter I typed for him was to Robert Bly,” she says, “and there were all these other well-known writers.” She gradually realized that the man she was working for was at the center of the American literary scene. He was an enormously prolific correspondent, who dictated ten to twenty letters a day and never let a letter go unanswered.</p><p>A continual theme in Hall’s early dictated letters was his worry about his wife, Jane Kenyon, who was stricken with leukemia. When Currier began in her position in late August, he and Kenyon were waiting for a blood match for a bone-marrow transplant. It was a time of great anxiety. But three weeks after she was hired, they got a call that a match had been found, and they quickly made plans to travel to Seattle for the operation.</p><p>Before they left, Hall set up a system for delivering his daily tapes by mail. He supplied Currier with stationery, envelopes, and money for stamps so she could send his letters back to him for a final proofing. Now he could stay in touch with friends, readers, and professional contacts with only a slight delay in his responses. Currier gradually discovered that Hall’s letter writing had another benefit: it gave him ideas for his creative work. After he repeated the same story from his daily life from one letter to the next, she says, it would sometimes appear in a poem. “I don’t know that he ever spoke or wrote about this,” she reflects, “but I certainly noticed it.”</p><p>Much of the Seattle correspondence Currier typed was about the progress and results of Kenyon’s operation. Early signs showed the transplant had taken, lifting their hopes. But in the weeks after the couple flew home to New Hampshire, her leukemia returned. Hall’s letters were consumed by sorrow. When Kenyon died in late April 1995, friends and readers across the country wrote to share Hall’s grief. “The outpouring of condolence by mail afterward was enormous,” Currier remembers. Hall insisted on answering every correspondent. “It was one of the busiest times I’ve ever had with him,” she says, “typing many, many postcards, notes, and letters.”</p><p>“Don was such a letter writer,” says Currier, “that he went on writing to Jane even after she died.” Hall’s letter-poems to Kenyon appear in his 1998 collection Without and take up nearly half of the volume. Offering spontaneous, intimate news of daily events to a recipient who cannot read them, the poems take us closer to Hall’s heartbreak than any of the more deliberate entries that precede them. They bring a new tone to his work.</p><p>“His grief was all he wrote about in his letters for a year after Jane’s death,” Currier says. As in the past, those letters, too, helped him with his poetry, providing observations and stories he later used in poems. Sometimes, “it worked the other way,” that is, he included in his letters things he’d already written about, as if to test their effect.</p><p>Currier had good reason to know about the links between Hall’s letters and poems. In July of 1996, Sharon Broughton, who typed Hall’s poetry and prose, married and moved to California, and Currier took over her work. So in addition to typing his grief-filled correspondence, she was also typing the poems of Without, draft by draft.</p><p>Currier’s increased responsibilities came at exactly the right time: her son Tyler was about the enter the first grade, freeing her from childcare for a longer part of the day. But there were problems for her at home. “My marriage was pretty bumpy at that point,” she says, and sometimes, when Hall pulled into her driveway to drop off his briefcase of new work, the two of them talked about their personal difficulties, Currier with her husband and Hall with the women he was now dating. They were alike in some ways, both of them without—he having lost his life partner, and she sensing she would soon lose hers as well. And through these unguarded conversations, a bond formed and their relationship deepened.</p><p>In late winter 1998, as her divorce neared, Currier became concerned that she would no longer have a home office to work from and would have to give up her job. She was greatly relieved when Hall stepped in to offer the cottage that once belonged to his grandfather’s hired man.</p><p>The cottage was just seventy yards down the road from Hall’s farmhouse, a much more convenient location than Currier’s house, which required a car ride. With Hall’s blessing, she got a friend to build a desk in the living room large enough to hold a typewriter, a computer, and a copy machine. Over the next several weeks, after she had completed the day’s typing, Hall would meet her at the cottage to unpack and organize the boxes from his mother’s house that had been stored there, boxes of family photographs, mementos, and linens. The process became the impetus for his later memoir, Unpacking the Boxes. In October, after the unpacking was complete, Hall suggested that Currier move in and make the cottage her permanent home.</p><p>Because her new residence was so close to his house, a single briefcase was all the pair needed now for their daily exchanges. When Hall finished dictating in the evening, he left the briefcase outside his house in a porch chair. Next morning, before the sun came up, Currier collected the briefcase, and returned it in the late morning, full of letters and manuscripts. “I became known as ‘that woman who carries a briefcase on Route 4 in the dark,’ ” she says. Sometimes she checked the farmhouse through her north window just to make sure things were as they should be—the lights on or not on, depending on the time of day, the car in the driveway where it belonged. Like the hired man who had lived in the cottage before her, she began attending to the rhythms of the main house.</p><p>The essential rhythm between author and amanuensis, the exchange of the briefcase, altered as time went on, moving later into the day. They developed a visual code. Currier was to watch for the briefcase from her window, and when it appeared on its porch chair, she would know her day’s work awaited. When she finished the work, she carried the briefcase back to its chair and placed it on its side, so Hall would understand that its contents were ready for inspection.</p><p>By the middle of 1999, Hall had assigned Currier an assortment of new chores—she’d become a trusted partner. She helped clear away Jane Kenyon’s clothes. She alphabetically shelved the new poetry books he received and sorted family photographs. Then Hall turned over all his bookkeeping to her, and when he traveled, put her in charge of his house to deal with his mail, faxes, phone messages, and the care of his pets. She even drove him to poetry readings around New Hampshire and well outside the state. In his letters and prose, Hall took to calling her his assistant.</p><p>For years, Currier had happily conformed her life and schedule to Hall’s, but now there was something she needed to do for herself. She wanted to go to college. Back in high school, when she’d brought up the subject of college to her parents, they were puzzled. Why would she waste her money on that, her father asked, since she’d be following her husband’s lead wherever he went? Ultimately, her parents relented, but only if she agreed to take up something practical. She chose a program in business and science at the University of Rhode Island, but only made it through introductory courses before she dropped out from lack of interest. In the fall of 1999, she enrolled in the adult education program offered by the University of New Hampshire. Then she selected courses in the humanities and began to learn about the world of literature, art, and thought.</p><p>In hindsight, Currier sees how much Hall influenced the curriculum she chose. “Working for someone whose life was literature was an eye-opening experience,” she says. “I was exposed to new ideas through Don, and I got to expand them by going back to school.” When she had extra homework, Hall adjusted her schedule, occasionally giving her whole days off to catch up. “He believed in higher education,” Currier says, “and he wanted me to have it.”</p><p>By his example, Hall also taught her how to write. During her time as a student, he was working on The Best Day the Worst Day, his prose memoir about his life with Kenyon, and Currier was impressed by his discipline and his pursuit of perfection. “He wrote the entire book in longhand three times,” she recalls, and after she typed up the third version, he scribbled revisions for retyping in the margins. “He would change a passage twenty times, and I’d say to myself, Oh my God, Don, please don’t change that again! But the twentieth time it would be so much better.” Guided by Hall’s passion for revision, Currier won high praise for her own written work; one professor even asked to use her final paper as a model in future classes.</p><p>In the spring of 2003, when Currier crossed the stage in her cap and gown to receive her degree, she heard her son shout from the audience “Way to go, Mom!” That same year Hall asked if he could dedicate a book of essays to her, Breakfast Served Any Time All Day, which she’d just finished typing. Currier was flattered, and surprised, too, though on reflection she surmised the reason for his dedication. As she typed the book, her admiration for it grew, and she told Hall that his essays about writing poetry would be helpful to anyone who wanted to write.</p><p>Still, she wasn’t sure about the book’s title, she told Hall, because she thought it had nothing to do with the content. He responded by editing his opening essay to explain the title. It was her college degree, she says, that gave her the confidence to tell him what didn’t sound right to her in his work, both in that manuscript and in others that came after. Her degree also gave her a different attitude when she sat in Hall’s audience after driving him to a poetry reading. She felt, she says, “more like I belonged there.”</p><p>Currier sent her question about the title of Breakfast Served Any Time All Day through their regular channel for communication: notes sent back and forth in the daily briefcase—he dictating his notes to her, and she typing a comment or question. In this way, Currier also told him about her multiple sclerosis. Since her disease had not interfered with her typing, she’d had no need to discuss it with him. But in the manuscript of a short story he was working on, one of his characters died of MS, and she was compelled to explain that people don’t generally die of MS. Then she had to explain how she knew.</p><p>In the first decade of the 2000s, Currier’s MS steadily progressed. First, she wore a brace on her left foot, then she began to use a cane. A few years later she graduated to a rollator walker. Today, she gets around on a disability scooter. In 2007, she began to type with voice recognition software because she was losing function in the little and ring fingers of her left hand— “a and s,” she says, “are very important letters.”</p><p>By that time, Hall had his own disabilities to deal with, the result of old age and a lifelong aversion to physical exercise. In his prose book, Essays After Eighty, he confesses his immobility: “I sit on my ass all day writing in longhand, which Kendel types up.” Five years earlier, in Unpacking the Boxes, he described how hard it was to raise himself out of his living room chair, a problem eventually solved by a mechanical lift.</p><p>Currier remembers how often Hall fell. One morning in winter, as she checked the farmhouse from her north window, she noticed his car had been warming up for a long time. When she went up to check, she found Hall lying in the driveway beside the car, unable to get up. Another day, as she entered the house, she heard him calling out in panic from the floor on the far side of his bed. Unable to lift him because of her own disability, she talked him into a position from which he could get himself up. On later falls, when he couldn’t manage to lift himself, she called the local fire department for assistance. Her list of responsibilities continued to grow; it now included the role of safeguard and protector.</p><p>In 2008, during the period of his falling, Hall got into his second car accident. Nobody was hurt, but he lost his license. This made it easier for Currier to keep an eye on him throughout each day, when she brought him his breakfast sandwich and Boston Globe and picked up the briefcase for work. Always the two of them talked a bit in the morning, and longer in the afternoon, when she brought her typed pages back to him and he’d finished his writing for the day. Sometimes the subject was their mutual disability. Currier told him about the benefits of getting around on a rollator, and once, after she began to use a scooter, Hall suggested she might one day want a grabber like the one his daughter Philippa bought him for grasping things beyond his reach.</p><p>Currier didn’t know about grabbers, and she appreciated the thought. Still, the most important way Hall helped her with her disability was simply by understanding. “He told me how horrible and unfair it was that I had MS,” she says, “and he was always very concerned about it.” For her part, she sympathized with him about the growing troubles of old age. Once, when he was depressed by his infirmities, she counseled him to try and see things differently, as she had learned to do with her MS, accepting life as it actually was, and finding the good in what might seem a hopeless situation. Hall was determined that people couldn’t change their feelings, and her advice never took. But the life she led by example did. He understood, she says, “that my sympathy was limited because I had my own disability. He knew he couldn’t play the disability card with me.”</p><p>Currier was not the only woman who looked after Hall in his eighties. There were several such women, and the locals had a nickname for them. Linda Kunhardt, the love of his life after Kenyon died, discovered the nickname when she dropped off some of Hall’s mail at the post office in Danbury, New Hampshire, and a clerk asked her if she was part of “Hall’s Harem.” The members of the group are listed in the dedication of Hall’s last book, A Carnival of Losses: his housekeeper, his personal trainer, two women who delivered his mail and his prescriptions, and, at the very top of the list, Currier, his all-purpose assistant, and by then, his dear and trusted friend.</p><p>Unlike the other helpers, Currier emerges in A Carnival of Losses and Essays After Eighty as a constant companion, a fully developed character who’s not afraid to pull rank when it comes to Hall’s best interests. She was especially worried by his smoking. In a passage from “No Smoking,” Hall relates that she once noticed “the carpet between my chair and a low bookshelf was burned away, as were the backs of some books.” When he explained that the damage came from a lost, burning cigarette, Currier was horrified and refused to leave the farmhouse until he promised to call her whenever he couldn’t locate a dropped cigarette. In the same essay, Hall describes the two of them on their way to New York City, Currier driving and he occasionally cracking his window to smoke. “Somewhere around Springfield, Massachusetts,” he writes, when he took out another cigarette, Currier parked the car and asked him to smoke outside. “I could not smoke in my own car,” Hall writes. “Kendel is kind, but Kendel is a hard case.”</p><p>The affection and respect Hall felt served Currier well in the period after he finished Essays after Eighty, when his mood turned dark. He was discouraged, not only because he didn’t have a subject to write about, but because even if he did, he wouldn’t have enough energy to manage the job. Watching him adrift, day after day, made Currier unhappy as well. She finally told him, “If you don’t work, I don’t work.” Those words “seemed to shock him a bit,” she says, “because I don’t think he’d ever thought about the impact he might be having on me.” Afterward she pleaded with him to “write anything, whether it was publishable or not, just to get writing again.” At her urging, he began the short essays of A Carnival of Losses—“notes,” as he called them, each tailored to fit his reduced periods of concentration.</p><p>The glaring exception to shortness is the essay “Necropoetics,” over twenty pages concerning Jane Kenyon’s influence on his poetry after her death. The essay was long enough and important enough for Hall that he gave it the prominence of its own section in the book. It was Currier who urged him to write the piece, first reading his thoughts about the theme of necropoetics in his letters, then prompting him, repeatedly, to explore them during afternoon chats. There’s little doubt that her encouragement was crucial not only to the creation of “Necropoetics,” but to Hall’s last volume itself.</p><p>Not long after he completed A Carnival of Losses, Donald Hall died. The memorial service, held in the South Danbury church, took place nearly two years ago.</p><p>Currier still lives in the small farmhand’s cottage, but the farmhouse, now empty, has been sold to a hastily formed group whose stated purpose is to preserve it. Currier now awaits the results of an application she has made to a nearby retirement community, and she has joined a counseling group to deal with the grief she feels. “I cannot look up there every day knowing that Don’s not there,” she says, “knowing there’s no reason to look anymore.”</p><p>But she has her memories. She recalls, for instance, the times she surprised Hall with results from her online research: biographies of poets he knew as a young man for his “Selected Poets of Donald Hall” section in A Carnival of Losses, or an early photograph of himself with an apple in his mouth, which she persuaded him to reprint with his essay “Dictating the Pig.” She remembers moments when he asked for her thoughts about a word or a piece he had written. She remembers especially how he honored her with his dedication for Breakfast Served Any Time All Day.</p><p>And of course Currier has the memory of her daily journeys with their shared briefcase, in all weather, from her cottage to Hall’s farmhouse and back again for more than twenty years, first in the dark on foot, sometimes in the winter on cross-country skis, and during her last years riding on her disability scooter, the briefcase tucked behind her legs under the seat. By that time the case showed signs of its continuous repair. “At first when the stitching at the seams came undone,” Currier says, “I would hand-sew it back together.” Later, as she lost the use of her left hand, she repaired the briefcase with duct tape. The record of its restorations honors the commitment of the two people who spent their life together, filling and emptying it.</p><p>Currier’s last official day as Hall’s amanuensis was in the fall of 2019. She closed down his email account. She deleted his emails from her private account, along with his remaining Word files. Then she sent in her final pay numbers to his accountant. With a few keystrokes, “I let go of what I’d continued to hold onto since Don died. It was far more emotional than I expected.”</p><p>Before Hall’s son, Andrew, and daughter, Philippa, dealt with the contents of their father’s farmhouse, they asked his housekeeper, his personal trainer, and Currier if there was anything each of them would like to have. Without hesitation, Kendel Currier requested Donald Hall’s grabber. He had told her there might come a day when she would need a way to grasp things beyond her reach. She needed it now. “Every time I use this grabber,” she says, “I find myself thanking him.”</p><p>Wesley McNair is the author of more than twenty books, including the recent poetry collections The Unfastening and The Lost Child: Ozark Poems, winner of the 2015 PEN New England Award for Literary Excellence in Poetry.

The Oliver Room, home to the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh’s rare books and archives, was something close to the platonic ideal of this concept. Greg Priore, manager of the room starting in 1992, designed it that way.</p><p>The room has a single point of entry, and only a few people had keys to it. When anyone, employee or patron, entered the collection, Priore wanted to know. The room had limited daytime hours, and all guests were required to sign in and leave personal items, like jackets and bags, in a locker outside. Activity in the room was under constant camera surveillance.</p><p>In addition, the Oliver Room had Priore himself. His desk sat at a spot that commanded the room and the table where patrons worked. When a patron returned a book, he checked that it was still intact. Security for special collections simply does not get much better than that of the Oliver Room.</p><p>In the spring of 2017, then, the library’s administration was surprised to find out that many of the room’s holdings were gone. It wasn’t just that a few items were missing. It was the most extensive theft from an American library in at least a century, the value of the stolen objects estimated to be $8 million.</p><p>There are two types of people who frequent special collections that are open to the public: scholars who want to study something in particular, and others who just want to see something interesting. Both groups are often drawn to incunables. Books printed at the dawn of European movable type, between 1450 and 1500, incunables are old, rare and historically important. In short, an incunable is so valued and usually such a prominent holding that any thief who wanted to avoid detection would not steal one. The Oliver Room thief stole ten.</p><p>Visitors and researchers alike love old maps, and few are more impressive than those in Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, commonly known as the Blaeu Atlas. The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh’s version, printed in 1644, originally comprised three volumes containing 276 hand-colored lithographs that mapped the known world in the age of European exploration. All 276 maps were missing.</p><p>Many of the library’s holdings had been donated over the years by the founder, Andrew Carnegie, and his friends. But in one notable instance, the library allotted money specifically to purchase 40 volumes of photogravure prints of Native Americans created by Edward Curtis in the first decades of the 20th century. The images were beautiful, historically valuable and extremely rare. Only 272 sets were created; in 2012, Christie’s sold one set for $2.8 million. The Carnegie Library’s set held some 1,500 photogravure “plates”—illustrations made apart from a book and inserted into it. They had all been cut and removed from their bindings, “except a few scattered throughout of unremarkable subjects,” a book expert later noted.</p><p>And this was just the beginning. The person who worked over the Oliver Room stole nearly everything of significant monetary value, sparing no country or century or subject. He took the oldest book in the collection, a collection of sermons printed in 1473, and also the most recognizable book, a first edition of Isaac Newton’s 98. He stole a first edition of The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith, a letter written by William Jennings Bryan and a rare copy of Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s 1898 memoir, Eighty Years and More: Reminiscences 1815-1897. He stole a first edition of a book written by the nation’s second president, John Adams, as well as a book signed by the third, Thomas Jefferson. He stole the first English edition of Giovanni Boccaccio’s Decameron, printed in London in 1620, and the first edition of George Eliot’s Silas Marner, printed in the same city 241 years later. From John James Audubon’s 1851-54 Quadrupeds of North America, he stole 108 of the 155 hand-colored lithographs.</p><p>In short, he took nearly everything he could get his hands on. And he did it with impunity for close to 25 years.</p><p>When a library finds that it has been the victim of a major theft, it can take a long time to determine what is missing; an inspection of each shelved item and its pages is a laborious process. But the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh’s rare and antiquarian collection had already been well documented, ever since the administration moved to establish an archive of the institution’s rarest holdings. Greg Priore, who had graduated with an M.A. in European history a few years earlier from nearby Duquesne University, was then working in the library’s Pennsylvania Room, a space dedicated to local history and genealogy. He was also pursuing a library science degree at the University of Pittsburgh, with an emphasis on archives management. Both on paper and in person, he seemed like the perfect candidate to run the new archive, and was hired in 1991 to oversee what became the Oliver Room collection in 1992.</p><p>Priore comes across as professional but easygoing, the sort of guy who knows a lot but wears his knowledge lightly. Just under six feet tall, with a resonant voice and a prominent mustache, he was the son of a local obstetrician and spent the bulk of his life within walking distance of the Carnegie Library. An important job at a prestigious institution in his home city was something like a dream.</p><p>After getting the job, he worked alongside a preservation specialist to assess the Carnegie Library’s rare and antiquarian books. In addition, two rare book experts hired to offer conservation advice found that the library had given little thought to preserving its oldest books. So the staff blocked off windows to get control of the climate, substituted metal shelves for the old ones made of wood, which can leach acid into books, and upgraded the security system. In 1992, the room was officially renamed for William R. Oliver, a longtime benefactor. For years it served as the jewel of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. Docents took patrons on tours, and C-SPAN said it was one of western Pennsylvania’s cultural high points. Scholars and journalists plumbed its archives.</p><p>In the fall of 2016, library officials decided it was time to audit the collection again, and hired the Pall Mall Art Advisors to do the appraisal. Kerry-Lee Jeffrey and Christiana Scavuzzo began their audit on April 3, 2017, a Monday, using the 1991 inventory as a guide. Within an hour, there was trouble. Jeffrey was looking for Thomas McKenney and James Hall’s History of the Indian Tribes of North America. This landmark work included 120 hand-colored lithographs, the result of a project that began in 1821 with McKenney’s attempt to document in full color the dress and spiritual practices of Native Americans who had visited Washington, D.C. to arrange treaties with the government. The three-volume set of folios, produced between 1836 and 1844, is large and gorgeous and would be a highlight in any collection. But the Carnegie Library’s version had been hidden on a top shelf at the end of a row. When Jeffrey discovered why, her stomach dropped. “Once a plump book filled with plates,” she would recall, “the sides had caved in on themselves.” All those stunning illustrations had been cut from the binding.</p><p>The appraisers discovered that many of the invaluable books with illustrations or maps had been ransacked. John Ogilby’s America—one of the greatest illustrated English works about the New World, printed in London in 1671—had contained 51 plates and maps. They were gone. A copy of Ptolemy’s groundbreaking La Geographia, printed in 1548, had survived intact for over 400 years, but now all of its maps were missing. Of an 18-volume set of Giovanni Piranesi’s extremely rare etchings, printed between 1748 and 1807, the assessors noted dryly, “The only part of this asset located during on-site inspection was its bindings. The contents have evidently been removed from the bindings and the appraiser is taking the extraordinary assumption that they have been removed from the premises.” The replacement value for the Piranesis alone was $600,000.</p><p>Everywhere they looked, the auditors found a staggering degree of destruction and looting. They showed their results to the head of the Preservation Department, Jacalyn Mignogna. She, too, felt sick. After seeing historic volume after historic volume reduced to stubs, she went back to her office and wept. On April 7, only five days after the appraisers had begun their inquiry, Jeffrey and Scavuzzo met with the library’s director, Mary Frances Cooper, and two other administrators, and detailed what they had already found—or, rather, not found. The next phase of their analysis would have a more pessimistic focus: Now they would try to determine just how far the collection’s value had fallen. On April 11, a Tuesday, Cooper had the lock to the Oliver Room changed. Greg Priore was not given a key.</p><p>Just about the only thing that keeps an insider from stealing from special collections is conscience. Security measures may thwart outside thieves, but if someone wants to steal from the collection he stewards, there is little to stop him. Getting books and maps and lithographs out the door is not much harder than simply taking them from the shelves.</p><p>While other cultural heritage thieves have gone to great lengths to avoid calling attention to their acts—stealing items of low value, destroying card catalog entries, ripping out bookplates, bleaching library stamps from pages—Priore took the best stuff he could find, and brazenly left the library stamps in, as the library would see when it began to regather the books. Despite this cavalier approach, he was astonishingly successful, more successful than any insider book thief in memory.</p><p>Priore and his wife, who worked as a children’s librarian, hardly had an opulent lifestyle; the couple lived in a modest apartment crowded with books. But they had four children, who attended private schools: St. Edmund’s Academy, the Ellis School and Duquesne University.</p><p>All indications suggest that he was perpetrating his crimes not to get rich but rather, as he told police, merely to stay “afloat.” For example, in the fall of 2015, Priore wrote an email to the Ellis School asking for an extension on tuition payments. “I am trying to juggle tuition payments for 4 kids,” he wrote. A few weeks later, he asked Duquesne officials to lift a hold on accounts assigned to two of his children, since he had made overdue tuition payments. In February 2016, Priore asked his landlord for an extension, falsely claiming his wife had missed work because of a heart attack. The rent was four months past due.</p><p>Priore lived close enough to the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh that he could walk to work in 15 minutes. One route took him past the famous blue edifice of the Caliban Book Shop, one of the city’s best-known cultural spots. The store was founded in 1991 by a Pittsburgher named John Schulman, who is 5 feet 7 inches tall and stocky, with close-trimmed, thinning gray hair and, often, a graying goatee blending into a few days’ growth of beard.</p><p>Schulman started his bookselling business in the 1980s, working out of a Pittsburgh apartment. Gregarious and diligent, he acquired the sort of status that comes from years of reputable work in the profession. He was a member of the Antiquarian Booksellers’ Association of America (ABAA), serving on its board of governors for the Mid-Atlantic chapter. He was also an appraiser for regional institutions, including the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University and Penn State. After decades selling rare books, he was familiar to most in the business and even somewhat well known outside of it: Thanks to appearances on “Antiques Roadshow,” he was PBS-famous.</p><p>For the most part, Schulman treated the books, maps or prints that Priore brought him exactly as he would process the rare and antiquarian materials he got from any source. He would describe an individual book in ways people in the market would understand and, depending on the quality of an item, list it on his website. But with the items Priore brought, there was an added step.</p><p>When a book of value or importance is acquired by a library, the institution marks it using one of several different kinds of stamp: ink, emboss or perforation. These marks, which state the name of the library, are meant to do two things: identify the rightful owner and destroy the value of the book for resale. Most major special collections, like the Oliver Room, also adhere a bookplate to the inside front cover.</p><p>To sell such a heavily marked book, a typical thief would have to tear, cut and bleach away this evidence; if he was not careful, he would destroy in the process much of what made the book valuable in the first place. Schulman found another way to ready a stolen book for sale. Using materials he kept at his store, whenever he got a Carnegie book from Priore, he or one of his employees pressed a small red stamp, bright as lipstick, on the bottom of the bookplate. It pronounced the book “Withdrawn from Library.” That mark was to counteract the others.</p><p>While there is a tradition of librarians and archivists stealing from collections they are meant to steward, not since the 1930s had a dealer as highly reputed as Schulman been implicated. In the 1970s and ’80s, a flamboyant Texas bookman and one-time president of the ABAA named John Jenkins made money selling stolen and forged items to libraries and collectors. But most of his malfeasance was confined to Texas—and no one who knew Jenkins would have been surprised to discover he was an outlaw. He was an indebted gambler who had burned his own store for insurance money, and his life ended in 1989 with a gunshot to the head (authorities differ over whether it was a homicide or a suicide).</p><p>Schulman, a constant presence at the major book fairs, seemed as rock-solid as any bookseller in the business—all of which made him the perfect fence for Priore. The librarian could not risk approaching dealers or collectors directly with the types of books he was selling, and the internet would have exposed him the first time he tried to sell an incunable. Priore simply could not have operated without Schulman’s help and good name—and Schulman could not have gained access to the Oliver Room’s big-ticket items without Priore.</p><p>Apparently Greg Priore knew he was about to get caught six months before it happened. In the fall of 2016, when the library administration was discussing the possibility of an appraisal of the Oliver Room—which would necessarily uncover missing assets—he argued against it. But his colleagues chalked it up to his general obstinacy against having others in his domain, an obstinacy that one librarian noted had grown increasingly pronounced as the years ticked by. Still, with or without Priore’s approval, the administration decided to go ahead with the assessment.</p><p>Priore talked to Schulman about it, and the bookseller tried to help his supplier by emailing a number of possible explanations for why many items were missing. Some items might be out for repair or loan, Schulman offered, urging Priore to create documents attesting to this. He also suggested saying the library’s former director, now dead, had talked about selling off some of the Oliver Room’s better books, and that he might have done so while Priore was away on leave. And Schulman proposed emphasizing “that the Oliver Room is fairly porous and accessible...[and] that there have no doubt been multiple opportunities for many different staff and visitors to enter the rooms without proper protocol.”</p><p>For his part, Priore suggested that the room’s defenses weren’t perfect. When library administrators interviewed him on April 18, 2017, he told Cooper, the director, that he did leave catalogers, interns and volunteers to work by themselves in the room. He added that maintenance workers—in particular, some men who had done repairs to the roof—had access to the room.</p><p>In the end, though, there was no way to hide his decades of crimes. Thousands of plates, maps and photographs were missing; clearly, this was not the work of a patron or workman who had enjoyed a few minutes’ unfettered access. Even if someone else had been stealing from the library, it would have been impossible for Priore not to notice so much was missing. In April he was suspended from his job and in June he was fired.</p><p>Pittsburgh police began a formal investigation in June, and on August 24 executed search warrants at Priore’s home, the Caliban Book Shop and a Caliban warehouse. Police questioned Priore the same day. It didn’t take long for him to come clean.</p><p>When police went to the Caliban warehouse, they brought along Christiana Scavuzzo of Pall Mall Art Advisors. She found, among other items, 91 of the Edward Curtis prints and seven maps from the Blaeu Atlas. Police also found the stamp that Schulman used to indicate that the books he sold had been deaccessioned from the library.</p><p>Bill Claspy is twice a graduate of Case Western Reserve University, with a B.A. and an M.A. in English literature, and today serves as head of special collections for the university’s main library. Despite his love for the humanities, he knows it is the sciences that keep the lights on at Case Western. That’s why he was especially sad to surrender an important book of scientific history.</p><p>In August 2018, he received an email from Lyle Graber, a detective in the Allegheny County District Attorney’s office in Pennsylvania, about a recently purchased book of early modern astronomy. “While reviewing evidence in this case,” Graber wrote, “it appears that in 2016 you purchased Quaestiones in Theoricas in Georgii Purbachii from...Caliban Books. Unfortunately, it is very possible that this book is among those having been stolen from the Carnegie Library and sold to unsuspecting buyers such as yourself.”</p><p>Schulman’s catalog description noted the book’s condition was “very good with minor ex-library marks.” Claspy retrieved the book from its shelf and saw what Schulman meant by “ex-library marks”: The first two pages had several stamps and an ash-blue rectangular bookplate from the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. Below the bookplate was a small set of red letters pronouncing the book “Withdrawn from Library.” Claspy carefully wrapped the book and sent it back to Pennsylvania.</p><p>Around the same time, a private collector named Michael Kiesel also received an alarming letter. Kiesel had purchased one of the incunables that Priore had stolen and Schulman had sold to a reputable dealer in England. That dealer asked Kiesel to return the book to Detective Graber, which Kiesel did.</p><p>Dozens of people—private collectors, librarians and rare book dealers—received similar letters that August. They sent the books and documents to Allegheny County, where they have become part of a small but extremely valuable library under the supervision of the district attorney.</p><p>This past January in an Allegheny County court, Priore pleaded guilty to theft and receiving stolen property, while Schulman pleaded guilty to receiving stolen property, theft by deception and forgery. The guidelines for such crimes recommend a standard sentence of nine to 16 months’ incarceration but include two other possibilities: an aggravated range of up to 25 months’ incarceration, and a mitigated range that could include probation.</p><p>Much of what governs sentencing in property crimes comes down to the numbers. The Pall Mall Art Advisors spent months determining the replacement value for each item Priore had destroyed or stolen outright. The total, they concluded, was more than $8 million. But even this number, they said, was inadequate, since many items were irreplaceable—not available for purchase anywhere at any price.</p><p>Claspy argued that the value of rare books, maps and archival documents cannot be measured by money alone. “This crime was not just a crime against my library, or the Carnegie Library, it was a cultural heritage crime against us all,” he wrote to the judge. The director of the University of Pittsburgh Libraries, Kornelia Tancheva, wrote that a rare book theft, “especially from a public library, is an egregious crime against the integrity of the cultural record and against the public good.”</p><p>Further, the Pall Mall Art advisers wondered what books might have been donated to the library in the future, benefiting the people of Pittsburgh, if Greg Priore had not devastated the library’s reputation as well as its holdings. The chilling effect on donors is one reason that many libraries, upon discovering losses from their collections, keep the matter quiet.</p><p>More than two dozen people wrote letters asking the judge, Alexander Bicket, to impose strict sentences—not always a certainty in crimes involving thefts from a library. At an in-person sentencing on June 18, where Priore apologized for his thefts (“I am deeply sorry for what I have done,” he said), several spoke about the terrible effects of these crimes. “We do not want an apology,” Cooper told the judge. “Any apology from these thieves would be meaningless. They are only sorry that we discovered what they did.” Still, Judge Bicket was not swayed. He sentenced Greg Priore to three years’ house arrest and 12 years’ probation. Schulman received four years’ house arrest and 12 years’ probation. Both Schulman and Priore, through representatives, declined to speak to Smithsonian.</p><p>After the sentences were made public, Carole Kamin, a member of the board of the Carnegie Natural History Museum, wrote to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that supporters of local nonprofits “were appalled at the unbelievably light sentences.”</p><p>Numerous booksellers have told me that they believe in Schulman’s innocence, saying he was duped—a view the bookseller himself encouraged in an email to colleagues before the sentencing, in which he insisted he pleaded guilty only to save legal costs and put the matter behind him.</p><p>Others in the rare book world, though, say the evidence gathered by police was convincing. For instance, Schulman did engage in legitimate business with the Carnegie Library over the years, and on those occasions when he purchased a book through proper channels, he wrote checks payable to the library. But when he bought books from Priore, he made the checks payable to Priore—or paid cash.</p><p>It was Schulman’s responsibility, as one bookseller told me, to notice there was something odd about the treasures Priore was handing over. The ethics code of the Antiquarian Booksellers’ Association of America states that members “shall make all reasonable efforts to ascertain that materials offered to him or her are the property of the seller,” and members “shall make every effort to prevent the theft or distribution of stolen antiquarian books and related materials.” Schulman was not only a member of the ABAA. He had served on its ethics and standards committee.</p>\",\"date\":\"2020-8-21\",\"link\":\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/theft-carnegie-library-books-maps-artworks-180975506/\",\"discrp\":\"Over 25 years, almost every book and map of value vanished from the Carnegie Library. How did the thief pull it off?.\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","{\"content\":\"<p>Dave Brubeck, in his lifetime, was the litmus paper of jazz, and most listeners turned red at the sight of him – either from rage at what they called his swingless, thumping pianistics, or out of embarrassment at having to admit that they rather liked what he did. Before Miles Davis went electric and Ornette Coleman bloomed, Brubeck was the surest name to start an argument. A cynical section of the jazz audience perceived his experimental nature as a search for a catchy idiom that might eventually bring him the triumph of a hit. And of course, this line of argument claimed a win when “Take Five” propelled the world onto the dance floor in 5/4 time.</p><p>Those poisonous atmospheres have largely dissipated now, so Philip Clark’s biography comes as a well-timed burst of clarity, except perhaps in the matter of form. Having learnt from Brubeck the art of obliging his public to take him on his own terms rather than see their usual expectations fulfilled, Clark has produced a book so oddly constructed that we arrive at the statement “David Warren Brubeck was born on December 6th 1920, in the small town of Concord, California” on page 302. There may be a smidgeon of bravado in that placement, but the author can hardly be blamed for prioritizing the ten days he spent in and around the Brubeck band bus on its tour of Britain in 2003, collecting the leader’s testimony, which was both frank and copious. I interviewed Brubeck a couple of times, once at some length, and I can’t remember a more obliging conversationalist, with one’s every suggestion properly weighed and no subject off limits. So Clark’s tapes succeed in setting all kinds of themes in motion, and taking us into his hero’s long and controversial career.</p><p>At the same time, some important information is too long postponed. Brubeck’s personality, both stubborn and accommodating, seems hard to decode until we belatedly meet his mother, Elizabeth Ivey “Bessie” Brubeck. Married to the professional outdoorsman Pete, a horse-borne cattle rancher, Bessie harboured ambitions to be a concert pianist. And these were not merely dreams. After having her three sons, she actually took off to London to be tutored by Tobias Matthay, Professor at the Royal Academy of Music, and his pupil, the future Dame Myra Hess. It was Myra who eventually terminated her studies with the words, “Bessie, go home to your children”. That was no doubt a realistic judgement, but Bessie’s hurt was compounded soon after, when Pete agreed to manage an enormous but isolated ranch far out in the Californian hinterland, away from the centres of music and culture generally. “I work and play my part”, she wrote in 1939, “but I am glad that each day brings me nearer the end of my disappointing life.” Her son read that reaction and copied it into his own unpublished memoir – and suddenly one can see where he acquired his fanatical resolve and determination not to be crushed by circumstance. He became his own man, to the extent where the record producer Teo Macero said he didn’t always find working with Dave “most pleasant”, because “he never wanted to take too much advice”. Of course it’s always possible that Macero gave too much of it.</p><p>It may have been his mother’s flirtation with musical celebrity, or her ambition working through young Dave, but he was certainly not intimidated by the greats of his own day. Never a good sight-reader, he could nonetheless write music, and offered sample fragments of composition to notables as unalike as Stan Kenton, the dissonance-friendly bandleader (“Bring it back in ten years”) and the relatively unwelcoming Arnold Schoenberg (“I got out of there fast”, Brubeck recalled). But it was the French composer Darius Milhaud, a member of Les Six, who became Brubeck’s major influence when he took up a post at Mills College in Oakland, California. Brubeck had barely survived the revelation of his weakness at reading, but his other talents, especially in the fashioning of counterpoint, saved him. From Milhaud, a jazz fan since his visit to Harlem in 1922, Brubeck acquired new and sustaining obsessions: polyrhythms and, more immediately, polytonality, the simultaneity of different keys. His 1946 Octet was already using these notions, and Clark is keen to show that the group comfortably predated the famous Miles Davis Nonet, the Birth of the Cool band, which some observers accused him of trying to emulate.</p><p>In any case, the two men were on different tracks entirely. Davis progressed through bebop, which Brubeck knew about – his group toured alongside Charlie Parker’s in 1953 – but took no part in. To jazz listeners and critics for whom bop had become the approved and obvious pathway to the future, that put him on the outside of a large and forbidding fence, the border of those badlands where only non-swinging, pseudo-classical music thrived. Curiously, it was Charles Mingus – bop-literate but not defined by that vocabulary – who pointed out the injustice of that banishment in an “Open Letter to Miles Davis” for Downbeat magazine. “He feels a certain pulse and plays a certain pulse which gives him pleasure and a sense of exaltation because he’s sincerely doing something the way he, Dave Brubeck, feels like doing it.” As for not swinging, Mingus pointed out, Brubeck “had the whole house patting its feet and even clapping its hands” at the Newport Jazz Festival.</p><p>By then, Brubeck had settled on the quartet format that would serve him so well. Clark takes us through the many permutations of personnel which led up to the famous team of Brubeck, Paul Desmond on alto sax, Joe Morello, drums, and Gene Wright, bass – Wright an African American whose inclusion brought out the best of Brubeck’s tenacity in resisting any and every racist call for his eviction from the line-up. Acute during tours of the Southern states, the race-mix problem was by no means confined to those territories. Even on NBC TV’s Bell Telephone Hour, a producer deliberately kept Wright out of shot, a ploy noticed by Brubeck, who withdrew the group from the show at once. They were replaced – a detail underlining the stupidity of it all – by Duke Ellington. A vital educational moment underlay Brubeck’s stance on these matters: the day his father, Pete, had taken him to meet the first Black man he ever saw. Pete invited the man to open his shirt, and there on his chest was the mark of a brand. “These things can’t happen”, Pete said. Brubeck’s eyes filled with tears when he told this story.</p><p>In the heyday of the Quartet, and of his saxophone sound, Paul Desmond was widely regarded as a kind of delicious vanilla sauce decanted over the crunchy stuff Brubeck provided at the piano. But in person, Desmond was not so smooth. Early in their acquaintance, he and the leader did not get on – Desmond was at one stage barred from entering the Brubeck home – and later, a growing appetite for alcohol and raffish night-life made him difficult to manage. In many respects, Desmond was different from Brubeck, who, for example, remained married to the same woman for seventy years. And yet in live performance especially, the two men shared many moments of musical fulfilment where an ecstatic can’t-go-wrong vitality took over their partnership.</p><p>Their signature piece “Take Five” took a long time to reach that carefree stage, and the difficulties the quartet initially experienced with its materials – provided in fragmentary form by Desmond, then unified by Brubeck – make up one of the book’s best passages. But before long, experiments with time-signatures became a habit, through albums like Time Out and Time Further Out, with their famously modish modern-art covers. Many listeners enjoyed the voyage of discovery, others heard only novelty taking the place of inspiration. Either way, it was scarcely unnatural for jazz to seek a world beyond 4/4 time. Even King Oliver, in the 1920s, recorded one waltz. If Brubeck had a fault here, it was in presenting these ventures in too helpful and welcoming a form. A track like the original “Unsquare Dance” is almost a demonstration piece for 7/4 time – and no tidy-minded tape editor, by the way, should be allowed to fade out or chop off Joe Morello’s chuckle of satisfaction as the resolution is reached, even if Brubeck’s piano ending does fall over itself a bit. As Bing Crosby used to say whenever someone pointed out a fault on a recording of his, “It shows I’m human”.</p><p>We are told that Philip Clark lives with his family “and more recorded music than he can ever listen to”. Brubeck’s music alone might account for such overflow. His output of albums became prodigious, and Clark manages to steer us descriptively through most it. Though it is a muscle he over-exercises, his talent for putting sounds into words will send many readers scurrying around the audio-hoards of the internet to hear how, say, this version of “Lover” might strike the ear: “Phrasing around Dodge’s insistent pulse, Brubeck, Desmond and Bates played Richard Rogers’s [sic] theme in 3/4 time. The mathematical permutations of 3/4 interlocking with 4/4 – adding up to ever-changing patterns of strong and weak beats colliding and rebounding against each other – floated the piece free from any single anchoring beat”. Incidentally, “Rogers” for “Rodgers”, is not the only slip of its kind: we also have the artist Edward Hooper, even in the index; arrangements by Herb Pomery, for Pomeroy; and difficult topics “poured over” more than once.</p><p>For a time, Brubeck’s music became a family business, with his sons rounding out the Quartet, and edging Dad towards rock fusion and electro-funk; and then there was a late quartet of established pros, with the energetic Bobby Militello on sax – essentially the group Clark shared the band bus with. My own last view of Brubeck at the piano was an odd one, the eightieth birthday concert of George Shearing at Carnegie Hall, where George and Dave duetted on Brubeck’s ballad “In Your Own Sweet Way”. It was affecting to see the comradeship of two veterans who had often been brutally criticized for what they were not, rather than praised for what they were. I thought Brubeck looked quite frail at the time, but he had more than a decade’s more music in him. When he died late in 2012, seventy years had passed since, in his graduation year of 1942, he had privately recorded a clangorous, headlong piano-solo version of “I’ve Found a New Baby”, worthy in parts of Art Tatum. It was something he remained proud of all his life. “People who say I can’t swing, or I’m heavy-handed,” he told Clark, “they need to hear this.”</p>\",\"date\":\"2020-8-17\",\"link\":\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/strange-times/\",\"discrp\":\"Before Miles Davis and Ornette Coleman, Dave Brubeck was the name most likely to start an argument among jazz fans.\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}"]
