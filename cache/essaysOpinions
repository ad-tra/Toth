In 1999, the philosopher Donald\\nDavidson caught his brilliance by coining the term the “Ramsey Effect”: when\\nyou discover that your exciting and apparently original philosophical discovery\\nhas already been presented, and presented more elegantly, by Frank Ramsey.</p><p>The 1920s were to be\\nRamsey’s only window in which to make his contributions. When the decade began,\\nhe was a seventeen year old, starting his mathematics undergraduate degree at\\nTrinity College, Cambridge. Before he graduated, he had demolished John Maynard Keynes’s new theory of objective probability\\nrelations; made a valiant attempt at repairing a defect in Russell and\\nWhitehead’s Principia Mathematica; translated\\nWittgenstein’s enormously difficult Tractatus\\nLogico-Philosophicus from German to English; and published a critical\\nnotice of the Tractatus for the journal Mind, which still stands\\nas one of the most challenging commentaries of that influential book. </p><p>This was a stunning run for an undergraduate. Keynes was building an economics empire at King’s and he knew a good thing when he saw it. In an impressive show of administrative skill and sleight of hand, he snapped up the young prodigy before Trinity could blink. Ramsey became a mathematics Lecturer and fellow of King’s College in the autumn of 1924. The next half of the decade would be even more productive than the first. </p><p>Ramsey didn’t let Keynes down. He wrote two papers in economics for Keynes’s Economic Journal. Each was so important that when the Journal celebrated its 125th anniversary with a special edition in 2015 of its thirteen greatest hits, the editors decided that both Ramsey’s papers needed to be included. “A Contribution to the Theory of Taxation” founded the sub-field of optimal taxation and laid the foundation for the field of macro-public finance, so much so that any research problem about optimal monetary or fiscal government policy is now called a Ramsey Problem. “A Mathematical Theory of Saving” tried to determine how much a nation should save for future generations and founded the field of optimal savings and development. </p><p>Ramsey also wrote, but didn’t publish, a paper in which he was the first to set out the theory of subjective probability and utility theory that now underpins much of the social sciences and Bayesian statistics. Another paper, which was published, contained a profound mathematical theorem that showed that in large but apparently disordered systems, there must be some order. That became Ramsey Theory, a fruitful branch of pure mathematics, with many still-unsolved problems and important applications in decision-making theory, communications theory and information retrieval in computer science. It is often explained to undergraduates via the Party Problem, which asks what the minimum number of guests is such that at least n will know each other. And in philosophy, he came up with important ideas that are now enshrined in terms including Ramsey Sentences, Ramsey Conditionalization, Ramsification and Ramseyan Humility.</p><p>It might seem that Ramsey was a dour thinking-machine, churning out a quantity and quality of work that left no time for life. Yet the opposite is true. He was that rarity among so-called geniuses – genial, open and modest. He was, as his brother, the Archbishop of Canterbury Michael Ramsey, put it, “very accessible to his fellow human beings”; he had “a total lack of uppishness”. “Never a showman”, said Ivor Richards, one of the founders of the new Cambridge school of literary criticism. Wittgenstein recounted that when he was working as a schoolteacher in a small village in Austria, Ramsey came to visit. In one of the classrooms there was a physiological diagram on the wall designed to show that certain “bad habits” could give one an enlarged heart. Ramsey opined that a pupil’s ambition should be to have as big a heart as he could.                       </p><p>Ramsey’s own heart was outsized, as were his laugh and his physical stature. His head, said the philosopher Richard Braithwaite, was pentagonal and his smile gentle; his “enormous physical size” was perfectly in proportion to “the range of his intellect and his devastating laugh”. Patrick Wilkinson, a colleague of Ramsey’s at King’s College, said that “He shook with laughter”. This genial young man was not going to miss out on anything. As an undergraduate, he was a member of the secret Cambridge discussion society, the Apostles, during one of its most vital periods, in which Russell, Keynes, G. E. Moore, Lytton Strachey, Lionel Penrose (the founder of British genetics) and others discussed and debated. He was active in the Guild Socialist movement. He then went to Vienna for six months, in order to overcome his sexual anxieties with the help of a psychoanalyst who had been a student of Freud’s. Immediately on his return to Cambridge to take up his King’s position, he asked a woman whom he had admired during sessions of the Moral Sciences Club and the Heretics Society, Lettice Baker, to tea. One thing quickly led to another and they soon married and had two beloved daughters. Lettice would become a renowned portrait photographer. The marriage was an open one, as both Lettice and Frank (but Lettice especially) were enmeshed with the Bloomsbury set of writers and artists, and keen on its freedoms. The marriage enabled Frank to have another great love in his life – the influential architect and reformer of social housing, Elizabeth Denby. He was an active hill climber, tennis player and swimmer. Ramsey died in January 1930, at the age of twenty-six, probably from Weil’s disease, a liver infection caught by swimming in the river Cam.                        </p><p>In addition to Keynes, Moore, Russell, Richards, Strachey and Wittgenstein, his intellectual circle included the philosopher Moritz Schlick; the economists Arthur Pigou and the young Richard Kahn; and the mathematicians G. H. Hardy and John Littlewood. While they each knew and admired a slice of Ramsey’s thought, it was Keynes who best understood the whole of his mind. In Keynes’s obituary of his young friend, he said that Ramsey and Wittgenstein had started off by helping Russell to perfect the system of Principia Mathematica. The effect was: </p><p>gradually to empty it of content and to reduce it more and more to mere dry bones, until finally it seemed to exclude not only all experience, but most of the principles … of reasonable thought. Wittgenstein’s solution was to regard everything else as a sort of inspired nonsense … Ramsey’s reaction was towards what he himself described as a sort of pragmatism … Thus he was led to consider “human logic” as distinguished from “formal logic”.</p><p>The fact that much of Ramsey’s work was highly technical and that much of it was unfinished at his death has resulted in many thinking, wrongly, that he shared in a common project with Russell, the early Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle – the project of searching for pure and unadulterated foundations for thought and action. While there are differences between the various philosophers who aimed at this broad goal, they all argued that a meaningful proposition can be reduced to its simple components, each of which will mirror or correspond or latch onto a simple object in the world. This is why their positions sometimes attract the label the correspondence theory of truth. On this account of truth, many propositions that seem highly important are not even meaningful or at least struggle to be so. These include the propositions of ethics, philosophy and much of what is important to science, such as universal generalizations and inductive conclusions. Wittgenstein’s famous last words in the Tractatus tried to justify his use of all that philosophy in the previous pages:</p><p>My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.)</p><p>Keynes knew that\\nRamsey was after something more “human”. Ramsey is well-known for delivering\\nthis response to Wittgenstein’s notorious last line: “But what we can’t say we\\ncan’t say, and we can’t whistle it either”.</p><p>Unlike the economists and rational choice theorists who would build on his work, Ramsey was not in pursuit of an ideal rationality. He did not think that we can understand decisions by studying mathematical models of conflict and co-operation between rational and self-interested choosers and he did not think that the best economy is one generated by the decisions of individuals, with minimal government intrusion. This will jar with the view that many economists have of Ramsey, for in his two economics papers, he seemed to produce classical and mathematically sophisticated utility calculations. But in his paper about savings, there was a clue about his true priorities – he insisted that the utilitarian argument for discounting the well-being of future generations (because some catastrophic event might wipe them out) was “ethically indefensible”. That is, an argument about ethics trumps the utility calculation. And in his famous paper on subjective utility theory, Ramsey was clear that keeping one’s degrees of belief consistent with the mathematics of probability is highly idealized and not suited for real-world policy making and economics. It “is too high a standard to expect of mortal men”. An ideal agent, having full or certain beliefs about every single thing, might always act in a way that he would expect to maximize utility. But people are far from ideal. Human fallibility and individual psychology are not mere frictions that interfere with the smooth working of decision-making. They are inextricable from the human condition. One can see the same anti-idealization impulse in Ramsey’s work on truth. In contrast to Moore, Russell, Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle, Ramsey’s approach, to use his own term, was “realistic”, as opposed to realist (that is: rejecting mystical and metaphysical so-called solutions to our deepest problems in favour of down-to-earth naturalist solutions). Indeed, in 1926, Ramsey started calling himself a pragmatist, which was almost a dirty word in Oxbridge at the time. His pragmatism consisted in characterizing the problem of truth as being largely a problem of human belief. Following the founder of American pragmatism, C. S. Peirce, Ramsey took a belief to be a habit of action or a rule with which we meet the future, evaluable in terms of whether or not it meets the future well. While he did not go all the way with Peirce and say that a true belief is one that we would agree on, were we to inquire as far as we fruitfully could on a matter, Ramsey thought there was something important in Peirce’s idea that the system which would best enable us to meet the future is true. </p><p>When Ramsey died, he was in the middle of writing a\\nbook in which he intended to develop a theory of truth that was both human and tied to the facts. This work is only\\nnow starting to be appreciated for its unified and powerful way of understanding\\nhow all sorts of beliefs are candidates for truth, including scientific and\\ncausal laws, inductive conclusions, counterfactual conditionals and ethical\\nbeliefs. None of these beliefs can be found in the boiled-down languages sought\\nby the realists. In the book draft, Ramsey illustrated the kind of approach he\\nwas taking with the following example:</p><p>To say a man believes in hell means, according to the pragmatists, that he avoids doing those things which would result in his being thrown into hell. </p><p>Such conduct will be useful to the man if it really saves him from hell, but if there is no such place it will be a mere waste of opportunities for enjoyment.</p><p>A belief is evaluated as true or false if it is\\nuseful or successful. But it is only useful if it is responsive to the way things are. That is Ramsey’s\\nattempt, in a nutshell, at combining the best of the correspondence theory of\\ntruth and the pragmatist theory of truth. The mistake the realist philosophers,\\nsuch as Wittgenstein and the logical positivists, made was to start with a\\npre-conceived notion of the way things are – one that rules out so much of what\\nis important to us. In the last year of his life, Ramsey said:</p><p>I used to worry myself about the nature of philosophy through excessive scholasticism. I could not see how we could understand a word and not be able to recognize whether a proposed definition of it was or was not correct. I did not realize the vagueness of the whole idea of understanding, the reference it involves to a multitude of performances any of which may fail and require to be restored. </p><p>Anyone familiar with the “later” Wittgenstein, with his focus on\\nmeaning as use and the multiplicity of our ordinary practices, will see that\\nthese ideas are clearly foreshadowed by Ramsey. It was Ramsey who was\\nresponsible for causing Wittgenstein in the 1930s to turn his back on the quest\\nfor certainty, purity and sparse metaphysical landscapes in the Tractatus and turn to ordinary language\\nand human practices – a kind of pragmatism, though Wittgenstein himself\\ndeclined to call it that (and Ramsey would not have liked Wittgenstein’s own\\nversion of pragmatism, in any case). </p><p>It was commonly thought that the realists of Ramsey’s day brooked no dissent. Robin Collingwood, at Oxford, certainly believed so. He, like Ramsey, was launching attacks on the “realism of Moore and the rest” in the late 1920s. In 1927, he bemoaned realism as being “the official philosophy of the day”, despite being “a very bad philosophy”. He wrote his intellectual autobiography largely to counter what he felt to be the marginalization of views opposed to realism. His own version of a human logic – a logic of question and answer – was scorned by his Oxford colleagues H. A. Pritchard and H. W. B. Joseph. Pritchard once growled at Collingwood: “I wish you’d get off the fence”.             </p><p>But in Cambridge, the young Frank Ramsey was also on the fence, trying to craft a position that respected both the subjectivity and objectivity involved in human inquiry. And he was also taking on the realism of “Moore and the rest”, to great effect. No doubt some of the respect he got was due to his technical brilliance. But a good measure of it was earned by the quality of his arguments both against that realism and for his own avowed pragmatism. </p><p>Wittgenstein, who wanted disciples, not critics, gave that respect only grudgingly. After Ramsey died, he said he had “an ugly mind”, was “a bourgeois thinker”, and only put forward “wearisome objections”. They had very different philosophical temperaments. Wittgenstein had argued in the Tractatus that philosophy cannot be done. It is literally nonsense, for it cannot be reduced to simple sentences that mirror objects in the world. The idea that philosophy, as we know it, is impossible survived in his later work, where he argued that philosophy is a kind of therapy aimed at curing one from asking philosophical questions. He counselled students not to do philosophy, but to do something worthwhile. And when those select few, such as Wittgenstein himself, engaged in philosophy, what they needed to do is “gnaw” at a problem, coming at it from many angles. Wittgenstein thought that “you can’t think decently if you don’t want to hurt yourself” – if you don’t want to suffer. This tendency was already present in the early Wittgenstein. Ramsey was unimpressed, calling Wittgenstein’s method “messing about”. Ramsey thought that philosophical problems could be solved, and went about solving a great number of them. He showed how to measure partial belief; he showed how we might think of counterfactual conditionals as true or false; he showed how we can talk about theoretical terms in science by employing an existentially quantified sentence containing only observational terms. Wittgenstein’s clear disagreement is reflected in those harsh words about Ramsey in the 1930s, while he himself was struggling to turn his back on the Tractatus. But later he paid Ramsey the most significant kind of compliment – he ditched the position Ramsey objected to and came round to something like Ramsey’s own. He thanked his old friend in the preface to the Philosophical Investigations:</p><p>since I began to occupy myself with philosophy again, sixteen years ago, I could not but recognize grave mistakes in what I set out in that first book. I was helped to realize these mistakes – to a degree which I myself am hardly able to estimate – by the criticism which my ideas encountered from Frank Ramsey, with whom I discussed them in innumerable conversations during the last two years of his life.</p><p>In the early twenties, F. P. Ramsey attended at least one course of my lectures. I had soon come to feel of him, as of Wittgenstein, that he was very much cleverer than I was, and consequently I felt distinctly nervous in lecturing before him: I was afraid that he would see some gross absurdity in things which I said, of which I was quite unconscious.</p><p>Russell, for his part, was happy with Ramsey’s assertion that “My\\npragmatism is derived from Mr. Russell \\n…  The essence of pragmatism I\\ntake to be this, that the meaning of a sentence is to be defined by reference\\nto the actions to which asserting it would lead, or, more vaguely still, by its\\npossible causes and effects”. Ramsey was referring to Russell’s 1921 The Analysis of Mind, which explored\\nthe idea that a belief is a disposition to behave. The realists were not so\\nbeastly, after all.</p><p>Ramsey’s untimely\\ndeath no doubt prompted searching questions about the meaning of life for his\\nfriends and family. But even on this subject, Ramsey left behind poignant\\ninsights. Indeed his remarks from 1925 on the problem of what it is to be human\\nremain as impactful as the dazzling achievements of his technical work:</p><p>My picture of the world is drawn in perspective, and not like a model to scale. The foreground is occupied by human beings and the stars are all as small as threepenny bits … I apply my perspective not merely to space but also to time. In time the world will cool and everything will die; but that is a long time off still, and its present value at compound discount is almost nothing. Nor is the present less valuable because the future will be blank. Humanity, which fills the foreground of my picture, I find interesting and on the whole admirable. I find, just now at least, the world a pleasant and exciting place. You may find it depressing; I am sorry for you, and you despise me. But [the world] is not in itself good or bad; it is just that it thrills me but depresses you. On the other hand, I pity you with reason, because it is pleasanter to be thrilled than to be depressed, and not merely pleasanter but better for all one’s activities.  </p><p>We should not focus on the vastness and the unknowability of the world, as Russell and Wittgenstein did, and to whom he was responding. Nor should we seek the meaning of life in a God, as did his brother Michael. Rather, we should direct our attention to what is admirable and conducive to good lives. We must find the meaning of life within our human, fallible, ways of being.</p><p>Cheryl Misak is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Toronto.

Alert to the transcendent in the everyday, he perceived a “moral quality” in the very light that fell on the Dutch Colonial homes and lush lawns of the commuter suburbs outside New York. His characters might drink too much, they might break their vows, but they are usually drawn back toward order and light. “Stand up straight,” he urged his readers. “Admire the world. Relish the love of a gentle woman. Trust in the Lord.”</p><p>It was something of a shock, then, when Cheever’s journals were published in 1991. The man who had hymned the love of man and wife was shown to be tormented by homosexual longing. (“Every comely man, every bank clerk and delivery boy was aimed at my life like a loaded pistol.”) The drunken escapades of his characters took on a darker cast when seen alongside his own grim battle with drink.</p><p>Even those who knew Cheever and had some sense of his contradictions were surprised by the journals. “They tell me more about Cheever’s lusts and failures and self-humiliations and crushing sense of shame and despond,” John Updike wrote, “than I can easily reconcile with my memories of the sprightly, debonair, gracious man, often seen on the arm of his pretty, witty wife.”</p><p>But perhaps the greatest surprise was Cheever’s deep religious feeling. Time and again, we find him seeking consolation at his village’s Episcopal church, moved by the sight of the Eucharist, consoled by the words of the Creed. “If my hands tremble with desire,” he wrote, “they tremble likewise when I reach for the chalice on Sunday, and if lust makes me run and caper it is no stronger a force than that which brings me to my knees to say thanksgivings and litanies.”</p><p>What was the nature of Cheever’s belief? He was not a dogmatic man. He took no interest in theology. But his keen spiritual sense had a definite tendency. Like so many of his countrymen, he sought to throw off his ancestors’ Puritan austerities. Rather than deny the flesh and despise worldly comforts, he sought to embrace all of life. His was an unascetic spirituality. Yet he could not escape ambivalence about the world he embraced.</p><p>John Cheever’s religious pedigree can be traced to Ezekiel Cheever, the first Cheever in America and headmaster of the Boston Latin School from 1671 to 1708. Samuel Sewall, a judge at the Salem witch ­trials, noted with approval that Ezekiel “abominated periwigs” (a fashionable item, which the schoolmaster would sometimes pull from his students’ heads). When Cotton Mather delivered Ezekiel’s eulogy, he praised the great man’s “­untiring abjuration of the devil.”</p><p>Long after Puritanism had ceased to be a vital force, this severe inheritance was sustained in debased form. Christian Science, a bizarre nineteenth-century heresy that arose in the hard, stony ground of Congregationalist piety, disdains the material world as an illusion. Cheever’s mother adopted this faith, and her son recalled how she confessed “to having been so enchained by the flesh that a cancer was destroying her.”</p><p>Christian Science, with its optimistic, scientistic promise that men can be healed through right thinking, is a far cry from the high and grand faith of Plymouth Bay. But Cheever’s experience of it made him suspicious of the broader tradition of Christian asceticism. Cheever at times reproached himself for a lack of self-denial. “When have I known the taste of abstinence and self-discipline?” he wrote. But he tended toward viewing every form of carnal love—homosexual and heterosexual, adulterous and conjugal—as a good. “What can this capricious skin be,” he asked, “but a blessing?”</p><p>When Cheever developed tuberculosis at age twelve, his mother refused to get medical help. He later reproached her for leaving him alone in a dirty house, where he was spitting blood and flailing in sweat-soaked sheets, as she went to church to introduce an Armenian refugee.</p><p>Given this upbringing, it is unsurprising that Cheever’s god at times seemed to be the spirit of hearth and home. Cheever was capable of skewering suburban comfort—the homes that looked (as he put it in one story) like “the temples in a sacred grove, dedicated to monogamy, feckless childhood, and domestic bliss”—but he was irresistibly drawn to the vision of order presented by the freshly mowed lawn and well-laid table.</p><p>“The simplest arrangements,” he wrote in his journals, “trees, a line of bathhouses, a church steeple, a bench in a park . . . appear to have a moral significance, a ­continuity that is heartening and that corresponds to my whole sense of being.” For Cheever, these quotidian forms of order were signs that the world was finally ­ordered toward something divine. They gave him “a sense of fitness that approaches ecstasy—the sense of life as a privilege, the earth as something splendid to walk on.”</p><p>“Goodbye, My Brother,” the first of Cheever’s collected stories, offers a full picture of Cheever’s religious sensibility. The narrator represents Cheever’s more expansive, humane side, while the narrator’s brother, Lawrence, represents the more severe instincts that Cheever never quite managed to shake. He finds fault in every foible and ­superfluity—the excessive drinking, foolish spending, and wandering eyes of his family. He is a caricature of the Puritans, animated by “perpetual guilt and the deification of the scourge.”</p><p>Lawrence’s dark view of the world captures a great deal of truth, but it is vanquished by a rapturous vision of the glories of man and nature. “Oh, what can you do with a man like that?” Cheever’s narrator asks. “How can you teach him to respond to the inestimable greatness of the race, the harsh surface beauty of life . . . ?” Just as the complaints of Job are overcome by a show of the majesty of God, Lawrence’s carping is overwhelmed by the grandeur of nature and humanity.</p><p>Such ecstatic moments may work well for concluding short stories, but they are not sufficient to sustain a happy life. The kind of order for which Cheever pined requires definite limits as well as vaulting realizations. On the morning after the birth of his youngest son, Cheever was standing on a balcony, watching a car full of rambunctious young men go by. He longed to join in their chaos and hell-raising. “But I have been [gallivanting] with the bucks,” he wrote, and “my longing for the permanence I have left is much more painful.”</p><p>In his journals, Cheever expressed his conflicting impulses in terms of a choice between two women. One, with yellow hair, stands for “a boundless chain of lighted rooms; the easy talk and laughter of friends and lovers; healthy pride, and a winning score.” The other, with dark hair, evokes a small, confined space. She is friendless, “and yet it is the declivity of her back that his fingers seem to want to trace.”</p><p>Cheever’s journals document his struggle to reconcile his simultaneous needs for chaos and order, a young man’s body and the love of a gentle woman. He chronicles his struggles in exacting detail, a self-examination equal to anything found in the spiritual diaries of Puritans. “I have not repaired the shutter on the west window. I have not got sand for the driveway or mixed fuel for the chain saw,” he wrote. “I have been drunken, dirty, unkind, embittered, and lewd.”</p><p>Cheever described the beauty of monogamy and conjugal love while failing to accept its constraints. He adored the language of the Book of Common Prayer—“the penultimate clauses spread out behind their predicates in breadth and glory”—but was not bound by its moral claims. He was right to resist the moralizing of some of his more politically engaged contemporaries. But his own stance verged toward complacency: “Without an indictment I seem to have no moral position—no position, in fact, at all.”</p><p>No position—but oh, what prose. Cheever was at his best in recording the splendor of the receding sun, the magic hours stretching from late afternoon to twilight: “The sun going down takes many forms,” he wrote, “gold, brass cauldrons, streaks of lemon yellow and then, unexpectedly, a field of rose.” It was fitting, then, that Cheever lived in the twilight hours of America’s Protestant settlement, in a land still warm from—but no longer illuminated directly by—departed certainties. As the memory of a Protestant consensus expired, Cheever gave us a doubting, wayward version of its spiritual poetry.</p>\",\"date\":\"2020-8-28\",\"link\":\"https://www.firstthings.com/article/2020/08/cheevers-god\",\"discrp\":\"John Cheever took no interest in theology.

His videos have poor production values: the camera looms too close to his face, and the lighting is often too bright or too dark. He records himself at his home office in Petersburg, Virginia (he abandoned his native Brazil during Lula da Silva’s first term), with crammed bookshelves visible behind him. If he’s not smoking as he talks, he’s ready to, with cigarettes and a lighter placed before him on his desk.</p><p>Carvalho speaks without notes on a wide variety of subjects, some with intellectual pretensions, others on the fringe of politics, if not reality. He has held forth on theories of perception in modern philosophy, and also claimed that PepsiCo uses the cells of aborted fetuses to manufacture its sodas and that the Inquisition has been unjustifiably traduced.</p><p>Remarkably, the seventy-three-year-old autodidact who, though the son of a provincial lawyer, did not complete his secondary education, exerts enormous influence in his native Brazil. A champion of the extreme right, his ideas appeal to Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro’s admiration for Olavo (as he is known, in Brazilian fashion, even to his enemies) was so great when he was elected that when the president visited Washington, D.C., not long after his election in 2019, Carvalho was seated next to him at an official dinner. On that occasion, Bolsonaro, whose policies and worldview are both echoed and reaffirmed by Carvalho, proclaimed, “The revolution we are living, we owe in large part to him.” In 2020, as the coronavirus continued its rapid, worldwide spread, Bolsonaro insisted that the virus presented no real danger. It was, he charged, “fake news” and just “a little flu.” Carvalho was quick to parrot his admirer. “This epidemic,” he said in late March of this year, “simply does not exist.”</p><p>Unlike Steve Bannon, to whom he is often compared, Carvalho has expressed no interest in serving in his country’s government. He aims for something bigger and longer lasting. As João Moreira Salles, the filmmaker and publisher of the magazine piauí, told me, “Carvalho wants to be the Brazilian Gramsci.” His ambition is to establish a right-wing, nationalist, hegemonic doctrine by force of will, and by means of videoconferences, articles, tweets, and Facebook posts. He has been facilitated in his mission, allowed to name ministers in Bolsonaro’s government—among them Ernesto Araújo, who Carvalho described as “the Brazilian most qualified to be minister of foreign relations.” Araújo has written that only “Donald Trump can save the West,” and that climate change is a “Marxist conspiracy.”</p><p>The reasons Carvalho has become so visible are likely related to the reasons that gave rise to Bolsonaro. Brazil’s horrific murder and crime rates might have played a part in shaking Brazilians’ faith in the existing system, while the money-laundering scandal known as Operação Lava Jato (Operation Car Wash) laid bare the corruption at nearly every level of Brazilian society and politics, working in Bolsonaro’s favor. The scandal’s complicated nature and cascading ramifications make conspiracy theories like Carvalho’s sound almost plausible.</p><p>Much of what can be found in Carvalho’s productions is fairly straightforward right-wing conspiracy fare, though couched in his pseudo-philosophical language. He opposes vaccination and believes Barack Obama was not born in the United States. More novel are his doubts that the earth revolves around the sun, and his skepticism about whether it truly is round, not flat. Most Brazilians are devout Catholics, but Carvalho nevertheless alleges that Christianity is in such a precarious state that “[i]n Brazil . . . pedophilia is more respected and protected” than the Church.</p><p>Despite Carvalho’s fervent support of Benjamin Netanyahu (a strongman after his own heart), he has trafficked over the years in many of the classic anti-Semitic notions of the far right, as well as more novel fabrications. Adding to the conspiracy theory about the Bilderberg Group and the Trilateral Commission, Carvalho updates the canard of the Elders of Zion, claiming there is a Consórcio—a consortium—that rules the world. This consortium, he writes, is a dynastic “organization of large-scale capitalists and international bankers committed to establishing a worldwide socialist dictatorship.” He describes George Soros as “a Jew who helped the Nazis seize the property of other Jews,” who is guilty of “financing every anti-American and anti-Israeli movement in the world.”</p><p>Elsewhere, Carvalho attacks the alleged nexus of big money, the left, and the Jews with more subtlety. The Frankfurt School, he claims, “was not only founded by a capitalist billionaire Felix Weyl” [sic] but was “always led by people from stylish families, like Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Leo Löwenthal, and their kind.” This description of the birth of the Frankfurt School did not keep Carvalho from alleging, in an interview with a right-wing American website, that it was founded by the Communist International as a means of weakening Western society.</p><p>This conflation of billionaires, Jews, and left-wing thinkers is hardly a secondary feature of Carvalho’s worldview. He holds the “cultural Marxism” it represents chiefly responsible for the moral rot of Brazilian and Western society. In this respect Carvalho is not an innovator. The far right has inveighed against “cultural Marxism” for decades, leveling complaints that are now resonating in the lower depths of the global movement Carvalho represents in Brazil. Anders Breivik, the Norwegian mass murderer, included “cultural Marxists” among his enemies in his 1,500-page manifesto, discovered after his killing spree in 2011.</p><p>But, for Carvalho, no group was more influential, or evil, than the Frankfurt School. Although he describes the writings of Adorno and Benjamin as “indecipherable,” he still asserts that since the 1960s the Frankfurt School has exerted a greater influence “over the national left than classical Marxism-Leninism” thanks to its propagation in universities. According to Carvalho, members of the Frankfurt School sought to prove that “all the values, symbols, beliefs, and millenarian cultural property” were “a fraud and a dirty trick.” Under their influence, romantic scenes in films were “replaced by explicit sex.” Music was no longer melodic and harmonic. Even women’s makeup now “had to suggest that they were dead or at least had AIDS.”</p><p>The political scientist Miguel Lago told me that Carvalho has even alleged that the correlation of cigarettes and lung cancer is an invention of “cultural Marxists.” The campaign to spread awareness of this seemingly unimpeachable fact represents, for Carvalho, the left testing its power to impose its will: if the left could convince the world of the relationship between cigarettes and cancer, then everything else was possible. For Carvalho, then, smoking in public is an act of political defiance.</p><p>“Cultural Marxism” describes a perceived cultural hegemony, not a political force. The real enemy, for Carvalho, is communism. A member of the Brazilian Communist Party from 1966 to 1968, he claims to have left after he “witnessed acts [he] considered sadistic.” Carvalho’s hatred of communist ideology is beyond measure, rivaled only by his joy in attacking it. Writing recently of his experience as a young communist and his subsequent, lifelong career as an anticommunist warrior, he wrote: “For someone who has helped to build a lie in youth, you cannot fathom the pleasure derived from destroying it in maturity, brick by brick, with the sadistic meticulousness of the wrecker.”</p><p>Communism in Brazil has a long and tortured history, but it has no more influence in the country today than it does elsewhere in the world. Yet Carvalho writes about the communist menace as if the downfall of the Soviet Union and its allies had never occurred. In a radio interview in 2000 he claimed that “we are on the brink of a communist seizure of power in a revolutionary process.” Earlier this year, with Bolsonaro in power and the opposition momentarily cowed, Carvalho continued to issue warnings that “the greatest frustration of a communist is not to have risen sufficiently in life to be able to have all rightists killed.”</p><p>At its core, Carvalho’s entire project is an effort to apply the Gramscian notion of hegemony to Brazilian society in order to cleanse it of “cultural Marxism” and all its diabolic influence. Carvalho “is obsessed by Gramsci,” observes Salles. “He wants to create a reactionary hegemony in the cultural realm, which explains his success in putting his people in strategic positions related to education and the arts.”</p><p>Gramsci and the idea of hegemony recur constantly in Carvalho’s writings, but in doing so he turns the concept on its head, insisting it has been achieved not by the ruling class, but by the opposition to that class. He also attributes to Gramsci and the communists—assisted by “cultural Marxists”—a long-term plot to take over the government, one that was in place even while the military was in power between 1964 and 1985.</p><p>With Bolsonaro in power, Carvalho has been able to weaponize his reactionary vision. As Salles told me, “One can argue that there’s presently no ‘intellectual’ in the world who yields so much power and influence over a national government.” Abraham Weintraub, Brazil’s minister of education, is a Carvalho disciple, evidenced by his claim that crack was introduced into Brazil by the communists to weaken the country. So is Roberto Alvim, the special secretary for culture who was recently fired after recycling (without attribution) phrases from a speech originally made by Joseph Goebbels, using the propagandist’s words to describe the future of Brazilian culture, with excerpts from Wagner’s Lohengrin playing in the background.</p><p>Despite his influence on Bolsonaro, Carvalho has expressed disappointment that the president has not taken a firmer stand against his adversaries. In March he tweeted that though the president was elected “to bring down the system, Bolsonaro, advised by timid generals and politicians, preferred to adapt himself to them. Suicide.” Carvalho boasted that though he had “advised [the president] to disarm his enemies BEFORE attempting to resolve any ‘national problem’ . . . [h]e has done the opposite.” These statements are an echo of Carvalho’s belief that the military demonstrated undue softness during its murderous rule. His use of the word enemies is, of course, not accidental. Though Brazil is a democracy, where opponents or the opposition would be the acceptable words to describe political rivals, for Carvalho, left-wing politicians are enemies who must be destroyed.</p><p>It is hardly surprising that Carvalho despises democracy. Given his patchwork of fringe political ideas, it is fitting that he is a disciple of the French thinker René Guénon, who died in 1951. Guénon’s antidemocratic notions and calls for an immutable, strictly hierarchical social order reflect Carvalho’s ideal society. Guénon wrote that “the decisive argument against democracy can be summed up in a few words: the superior cannot proceed from the inferior.” In keeping with this medieval view of society, Carvalho believes that intellectuals of his kind have a special role: he identifies a “priestly or sacerdotal caste,” an “intelligentsia” whose job it is to guide the state in driving “the process of modernization, and thus, to determine the meaning of collective life, its values and moral criteria, to define what is right and what is wrong, what is true and what is false.”</p><p>Carvalho continues to press Bolsonaro from the right, urging him to be even more extreme. “What,” he asked in March, “has Bolsonaro done against ANY of his enemies? NOTHING. NOTHING EVER. He’s only dealt them pinpricks, irritating them instead of weakening them.” If his statements, tweets, Facebook posts, writings, and lectures are indeed the works of a philosopher, they are those of a philosopher as described by the thinker he considers the source of much of the world’s evil. Karl Marx, in his eleventh thesis on Feuerbach, wrote, “The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it.”</p>\",\"date\":\"2020-8-27\",\"link\":\"https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/the-gramsci-of-the-brazilian-right\",\"discrp\":\"Olavo de Carvalho, a 73-year-old right-wing autodidact, is on a mission: He wants to become the Brazilian Gramsci.\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","failed","{\"content\":\"<p>At the start of 1873, Leo Tolstoy was fresh from the success\\nof War and Peace and aware that the world was expecting an equally\\nmonumental work of art, something that would match that book (he refused to\\ncall it a novel) in historical scope and philosophic profundity. As such, he\\nwas consumed with writing a primer to teach Russian children the alphabet. He\\nwas sure it would be his legacy. “My proud hopes are\\nthese,” he wrote to a friend, “that two generations of all Russian children,\\nfrom those of the tsar to those of the peasants, will learn using only this\\nprimer, and they will get their first poetic impressions from it, and that,\\nhaving written this primer, it will be possible for me to die peacefully.”</p><p>Perhaps it was this obsession with letters, the\\nbeauty of their shape and the world of possibilities encoded in each one, that\\ncan explain the curious second proposal scene between Kitty and Levin in Anna\\nKarenina (she rejected his first) in which the two communicate using just\\nthe first letter of each word they want to say. “He wrote the initial letters, w, y, a, m, t, c, b, d, t, m, n, o, t,”\\nand Kitty understands intuitively that Levin is asking her. “When you answered\\nme, ‘that cannot be,’ did you mean never or then?” Only t, only “then”\\nit turns out, to Levin’s great happiness. In Creating Anna\\nKarenina, Robert Blaisdell does not make this connection between Tolstoy’s\\nwork on the alphabet book and this scene from the novel, but it is the type of\\nparallelism between the great Russian author’s life and art that interests him.  </p><p>A professor of English at the City University of\\nNew York (Kingsborough), Blaisdell learned Russian in order to read the Anna\\nKarenina novel in the original (after having first reread the novel in the English translation upwards of 20 times). The work of a Tolstoy superfan rather\\nthan a Tolstoy scholar per se, Creating Anna Karenina is an\\ninformal and chatty effort to understand what Tolstoy was up to in the four\\nyears he spent composing the novel. As it turns out, Blaisdell tells us, he was\\ndrinking\\ncopious amounts of “koumiss” (fermented mare’s milk) to stave off tuberculosis, penning vociferous calls for agrarian reform, learning Ancient Greek with the\\nhelp of a priest, and trying to find a governess to tend to his growing family.\\nThe latter situation had gotten particularly desperate; Tolstoy wrote to a\\nfriend begging for references. “Nationality is of no matter: German, French,\\nEnglish, Russian—as long as it’s European and\\nChristian. Salary—everything I can give.” Blaisdell wonders if Tolstoy had this\\nstress in mind when he decided to open Anna Karenina with the story of a\\nhouse torn to pieces by a governess’s dismissal\\n(though of course in the novel it happens under more adulterous circumstances). </p><p>It is a big stretch, and Blaisdell knows as much, but his\\nbook is more of a playful experiment than a strict study. In its study of the\\ncomings and goings of the Tolstoy household at the time of the novel’s\\ncomposition, Creating Anna Karenina asks if one of the world’s greatest\\nnovels was in fact just as much a product of everyday minutia—like who stops by\\nfor a visit with what kind of gossip to tell—as it was the culmination of\\nlong-simmering ideas about morality and desire. The result is a work in many\\nways more instructive about the creative process than about Anna Karenina\\nspecifically, a consideration of how distractions, familial interference, and\\nside projects resulted in Tolstoy writing one of the world’s greatest novels.</p><p>The inspiration behind the character of Anna Karenina\\nis widely considered to be a 37-year-old woman named Anna Stepanova, who worked\\nas a housekeeper for one of Tolstoy’s neighbors. She and her husband regularly\\nargued about his flirtations with governesses. Finally, she became so consumed\\nwith jealousy that she threw herself under a train but\\nnot before sending off a letter addressed to her husband, which reportedly read, “You are my killer; you will be happy with her if murderers can be happy. If\\nyou want to see me, you can view my body on the rails of Yasenki.” As the\\nfamily knew the woman well, Tolstoy personally went to observe the autopsy; his\\nwife wrote to a friend that he “was terribly shaken. He had known Anna\\nStepanovna as a tall, stout woman, Russian in face and character, a brunette\\nwith grey eyes, not beautiful but attractive.” The episode happened in 1872,\\njust a year before Tolstoy first sketched out the character of Anna Karenina,\\nwho likewise had gray eyes. </p><p>In March of 1873, Tolstoy told his wife, Sophia,\\nthat he had written a page-and-a-half and was “pleased with it.” She assumed he\\nwas referring to the major book he had been planning to write about Peter the\\nGreat, a fitting historical epic to follow War and Peace. Before this\\nrevelation, Tolstoy had been struggling greatly to write. “My\\nwork is not moving” he wrote his friend, the poet Afanasy Fet. To another, he\\ncomplained, “Everything has been arranged so as to distract me: acquaintances,\\nhunting, a court session in October with me as a juryman, and then the\\npainter,” the latter referring to the portrait artist who had been sent to\\nTolstoy’s estate to paint him on behalf of the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow.</p><p>The artist, Blaisdell writes, did however prove useful in\\noffering some gossip from the capital. Anna Suvorina, the wife of a prominent\\npublicist, was shot to death in a hotel in Saint Petersburg by a young man who\\nhad been in love with her. After killing Suvorina, the young man took his own\\nlife. The press was transfixed by the story as it combined society gossip with a\\ncrime of passion, and it all unfolded in one of the capital’s glitziest hotels.\\nTolstoy, too, was fascinated when he heard about it from the portraitist and\\nasked a friend to send him “any details of the murder.” Blaisdell sees the\\nepisode as an example of Tolstoy’s growing fascination with suicide: Tolstoy’s\\neditor, Mikhail Katkov, soon afterward lost a brother to suicide, and in his\\nconversion memoir, A Confession (1881), Tolstoy admitted that he too had\\ncontemplated ending his own life around this time. Linking these stories with Anna’s\\nsuicide (and her lover Vronsky’s attempt to do so), Blaisdell identifies a\\nlarger epidemic of suicides that was sweeping the country, a symptom of a\\ndeeper, collective depression rather than just the result of a single love\\naffair gone awry. Indeed, the failures of Tsar Alexander II’s reforms to lead\\nto meaningful change had blanketed Russian society of the 1870s with a sense of\\ndisorientation and dread. In the next decade, Alexander II would die at the\\nhands of a suicide bomber.</p><p>Blaisdell threads these biographical resonances throughout Creating\\nAnna Karenina, presenting a view of Tolstoy’s life that makes the writing\\nof Anna Karenina feel almost inevitable. As well as the crimes of\\npassion that seem to abound in Tolstoy’s social circle, there is also the\\nsummer he spends on the Russian steppe witnessing firsthand the poor implementation\\nof the government’s agrarian reforms. Such experiences, scholars agree, no\\ndoubt played a role in his fashioning of the character of Konstantin Levin, who\\nfunctions in the novel as a kind of mirror of Tolstoy, a wealthy landowner who\\ntries to settle his crisis of faith by laboring alongside peasants in the\\nfields. </p><p>Despite these sources for inspiration seemingly all around\\nhim, Tolstoy still struggled to write throughout 1872. His breakthrough the\\nfollowing March came when by chance he started leafing through the collected\\nworks of Alexander Pushkin. Suddenly, for reasons unclear, Tolstoy was jolted\\ninto action and sketched the entire plot of Anna Karenina in short\\norder. As he wrote to a friend at the time, “I thought up characters and\\nevents, began to go on with it, then of course changed it, and suddenly all the\\nthreads became so well and truly tied up that the result was a novel which I\\nfinished in draft form today, a very lively, impassioned and well-finished\\nnovel which I’m very pleased with and which will be ready in 2 weeks-time if\\nGod gives me strength.”</p><p>Two weeks turned into four years, as it happens. After\\nsubmitting the first installment, which was published in The Russian Herald (the same journal that earlier published War\\nand Peace and Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment), Tolstoy found\\nhimself distracted and disinterested. “My God,” he wrote to his friend, the\\nliterary critic Nikolai Strakhov, “if only someone would finish A. Karenina for\\nme! It’s unbearably repulsive.” Tolstoy’s wife Sonia, who did his copying, had\\nbeen ill from consecutive pregnancies and sick with grief after losing a\\ndaughter just hours after giving birth. Tolstoy also absorbed himself into his\\nschool for peasant children, further developing his alphabet primer, and\\noften wondered if Anna Karenina was a useless indulgence in comparison\\nwith his work on education. The latter half of Blaisdell’s book is rife with\\nletters to friends that show how plagued with self-doubt Tolstoy was at this\\ntime. “I’m disgusted with what I’ve written,” he\\ntells Strakhov. “I need to cross it all out\\nand throw it away and disown it and say ‘I’m sorry, I won’t do it again.’” </p><p>Such letters are perhaps the highlight\\nof Creating Anna Karenina because they bring us closer to Tolstoy’s\\ninner world and creative process in a book that otherwise feels overly terrestrial.\\nFor Blaisdell, the story of how Anna\\nKarenina was made is firmly tied to what Tolstoy’s life looked like on a\\nday-to-day basis—whose governess was seen with whom. This method has its\\nlimitations. Blaisdell tells us about the changes that occurred between drafts\\nbut offers little insight into why Tolstoy, who initially sketched Anna as\\ncontemptible, silly, and unattractive, transformed her into one of literature’s\\nmost charismatic and complex heroines.</p><p>To do so would require a much deeper\\nengagement with the French novel of adultery, to which Anna Karenina was a direct response. Blaisdell only briefly alludes\\nto the Alexander Dumas fils essay “Man-Woman” (1872), which claimed that men had\\nthe right to kill unfaithful wives (the essay ends with the words “Tue-la,” or “kill her”). Despite her grim fate, Tolstoy’s adulteress was treated with\\nrelative sympathy and complexity compared to her French antecedents. In\\nultimately refusing to make Anna a caricature of cruelty or Karenin a totally\\npure and pitiful soul, Tolstoy undid the conventions of the genre, preferring to\\nexplore the potential for anyone to be overtaken by desire.</p><p>To read Anna Karenina this way requires not seeing\\nTolstoy as simply a sui generis artist who stumbled around his estate\\ncollecting anecdotes. Like all writers, Tolstoy read voraciously and borrowed\\nextensively; his art was a response to other art as much as it was to daily\\nlife. Perhaps Blaisdell has simply fallen for Tolstoy’s tricks, his feats of\\nrealism that make you forget you are reading a deeply plotted and contrived\\nwork of fiction. The short story writer Isaac Babel said of him: “If the world\\ncould write by itself, it would write like Tolstoy.” Or at least like he wrote\\nwhen he finally got around to the task. The curative mare’s milk, it turns out,\\nwas slightly alcoholic; unable to get any writing done, Tolstoy wrote his\\ndaughter: “Laziness quite overpowers one when taking koumiss.”</p><p>Jennifer Wilson is a writer.

These lifeless bits of sea dander are actually the decomposing particles of animals who died hundreds of feet above the midnight zone. The vampire squid reaches for this snow with two long ribbons of skin, which are separate from its eight tentacles. If it is truly hungry, it trains its large eye on a glow, the lure of something larger—a gulper eel, perhaps, or an anglerfish waddling through the inky water. The squid’s eye is about the size of a shooter marble, but this is nevertheless the largest eye-to-body ratio of any animal on the planet.</p><p>If the squid feels threatened or wants to disappear, perhaps no other creature in the ocean knows how to convey that with a more dazzling yet effective show. When the vampire squid pulse-swims away, each of its arm tips glow and wave in different directions, confusing for any predator. To make an even more speedy getaway, the squid uses jet propulsion by flapping its fins down toward its mantle and simultaneously blasting a stream of water from its siphon—all of its arms in one direction. In the next stroke, the squid raises all of its arms over its head in what is called a “pineapple posture.” The underside of these arms is lined with tiny toothlike structures called “cirri,” giving an appearance of fangs ready to bite down on anything that wants to chase it down for a snack.</p><p>As if that wasn’t enough to shoo away a predator, the vampire squid discharges a luminescent cloud of mucus instead of ink. The congealed swirl and curlicue of light temporarily baffles the predator, who ends up not knowing where or what to chomp—while the vampire squid whooshes away, meters ahead. It’s as if you were chasing someone and they stopped, turned, and tossed a bucketful of large, gooey green sequins at your face. </p><p>I wished I was a vampire squid the most when I was the new girl in high school. We had moved around for so much of my childhood, but the most difficult move I ever made was between my sophomore and junior years. I moved from a class of about a hundred students in western New York to well over five hundred in Beavercreek, a suburb of Dayton, Ohio. I went from sophomore class president to a little no one, a gal who tried out for the tennis team not because I had any interest in the sport but because at practice, at least, I didn’t have to be alone. I ate lunch in the library. I ate lunch in a stairwell hardly anyone used. I ate lunch in the dark enclave of the only elevator, hidden outside anyone’s eyesight, except for the occasional student on crutches or in a wheelchair. Once I ate lunch—my sad peanut butter and jelly sandwich—while standing up in a scratched and markered-up bathroom stall. To pass the hour, I read the often vulgar, sometimes funny graffiti scrawled on the stall door, just so no one could see that I had no one to talk to.</p><p>This was my cephalopod year, the closest I ever came to wanting to disappear or sneak away into the deep sea. I had never feared the first day of classes or meeting new people before. After tennis practice, when everyone else was making plans to meet up at the local pizza parlor, I made myself vanish. I don’t know if my teammates even noticed, or wondered where I went.</p><p>Oh, I didn’t finish high school like that, swimming in darkness. I did end up making friends, giggling with them in the back of the school bus. I joined a bunch of delightfully nerdy pals on the speech and debate team, and I eventually made the varsity tennis team, playing doubles at the district level with my sister. There was no hiding anymore. People noticed when I had to leave parties early for my curfew. They didn’t want me to go. And I had a teacher—Ms. Harding—who wanted me to shine. I know it sounds incredibly precious, but these friends made me believe the mantra “If one of us does well, we all do well.” They were generous with their support. Playing it cool was boring. They were my kinfolk, my people—many of whom I’m still friends with today, though we’ve scattered across the country, spilling out in different directions as fast as we could once we’d tossed our graduation caps in the air.</p><p>But there wasn’t one specific turning point where I stopped trying to disappear. I don’t know how I wiggled out of that solitude, how I made it through the darkest and loneliest year of my youth. No more of those half-eaten lunches hurriedly tossed into the trash. No more make-believe “research” I pretended to do so the librarian would just let me read in peace. Instead, I began scribbling in notebooks and notebooks, trying to write my way into being since I never saw anyone who looked like me in books, movies, or videos. None of this writing was what I would remotely call poetry, but I know it had a lyric register. I was teaching myself (and badly copying) metaphor. I was figuring out the delight and pop of music, and the electricity on my tongue when I read out loud. I was at the surface again. I was once more the girl who had begged my parents and principal to let me start school a whole year early. And I was hungry.</p><p>I emerged from my cephalopod year, exited my midnight zone. But I’m grateful for my time there. If not for that shadow year, how would I know how to search the faces of my own students? Or to drop everything and check in, really check, with each of my sons when they come home from school, to make sure they are having a good time and feel safe? If not for that year where no one talked to me on the school bus, where I had no valentines, no dates, I wouldn’t know what to say to my student with the greasy backpack, who sits in the corner by herself and doesn’t make eye contact. Who never talks in her other classes and never spoke in my class unless called upon. I wouldn’t know how to tell if her solitude is voluntary or if it covers up a hunger to be seen, to glow with friendship like I had every other year. I secretly love the audacity of her tousled hair, stacked into a giant sloppy bun on top of her head—this student who constantly shuffles in late and is the last to leave but always, always reads ahead on the syllabus. The one who tells me after I come back from being out sick with the flu for a whole week: I missed you, I am so, so glad you were here today.</p><p>Me too, I say. And I mean it. I wouldn’t know how wide and how radiant a student like that could make me smile.</p><p>Aimee Nezhukumatathil is the author of four collections of poems, including, most recently, Oceanic, winner of the Mississippi Institute of Arts and Letters Award.

Available to download as e-books, with physical boxsets being supplied to libraries, the project, according to Bailey’s and the prize, is “finally giving female writers the credit they deserve”. </p><p>Well intentioned and laudable though this aim is, one may also\\nargue that it misses the point of the pseudonymous writer, and the difference between\\nthe public and the private self, let alone the question of self-identification.\\nThese are subjects that should be treated with more sensitivity in these\\npluralistic times. </p><p>Does George Eliot, whose Middlemarch\\nis featured here, really need “reclaiming” as Mary Ann Evans? The “Reclaim Her Name”\\nbio glibly states that Eliot was “forced to use a male pen name”, as if she\\nwere incapable of making her own decisions. \\n“George Eliot” was Evans’s public persona, with, surely, no need for\\nretrospective correction. By the time\\nMiddlemarch was published, the reading public was fully aware of its author’s\\nreal identity. Besides, by 1871/72, when Middlemarch\\nfirst appeared in instalments, the name she was known by was Marian Evans\\nLewes, as the common-law wife of her partner George Henry Lewes. According to\\nthe Oxford Dictionary of National\\nBiography, “Mary Ann” was not used by Eliot from 1851 until 1880, the last\\nyear of her life, when she chose “Mary Ann Cross” on her marriage to John\\nWalter Cross. Intentions matter, but so does legacy. Is it really for others to\\nspeak for Eliot/Evans and designate a different agency? </p><p>The writer Vernon Lee, meanwhile, whose supernatural fiction\\nand art criticism should certainly be better known, has her gothic horror novel\\nThe Phantom Lover republished under\\nViolet Paget, a name that Lee – a lesbian and a feminist –  chose, in her life as in her writing, and for\\nher own reasons, to cast off. (I had to double-check that Radclyffe Hall, the author\\nof The Well of Loneliness, doesn’t\\nappear in this list,  unwillingly recast\\nwith her birth, or “dead name” of Marguerite.)</p><p>Indiana, published in 1832 under “the male pseudonym used by the\\n19th century French novelist Amantine Aurore Dupin” (according to the BBC\\nwebsite) is also given a make-over. Again, this is misleading. It was Sand who\\nwas the novelist, not Dupin. “George Sand” was as much a part of her image as\\nthe men’s clothes she wore and the tobacco she openly smoked. (Indiana was the first novel Sand\\npublished independently under her chosen pen name.) Sand was the most popular\\nwriter in Europe of any gender by the age of twenty-seven, and enjoyed greater\\npopularity in England during the 1830s and 40s than her fellow French novelists\\nHonoré du Balzac or Victor Hugo, the latter of whom, at his funeral eulogy for her\\nin 1876 commented: “George Sand was an idea. She has a unique place in our age”.\\nAnd yet “Reclaim Her Name” sums her up with the line: “her romances were known\\nworldwide. It’s time her name was too”.</p><p>On the other hand, Liz Petry, the daughter of Ann Petry, perhaps best known as the author of The Street, is delighted that her mother’s novel Marie of the Cabin Club, which originally appeared in 1939 under the pseudonym Arnold Petri, is being bought out under her real name. “I’m incredibly proud of my mother’s work and it excites me that her writing has been introduced to a new audience”, she said. This rectifying seems entirely fitting for Petry, a writer who went on to publish under her own name; but the troubling aspect of the Bailey’s project is that its rather superficial analysis and one-size-fits-all approach overlooks the complexities of publishing history, in which pseudonyms aren’t always about conforming to patriarchal or other obvious standards. The relentless obsession in recent years with the “unmasking” of the writer who goes by the name of Elena Ferrante is a case in point, as is the fact that writers the world over routinely use pseudonyms or anonymity because of fear of prosecution or even death. </p><p>There is a danger here of being ahistorical rather than historically accurate. Virago Press, which launched its first modern classic in 1978, beginning a list of women writers who were then largely forgotten, notably kept the pen name of George Egerton, the author of Keynotes. Keynotes is republished by the “Reclaim Her Name” project under the name Mary Bright, although Egerton was born Mary Chavelita Dunne, and “Golding Bright” was her husband’s surname. “Mary Bright”, therefore, seems to be a name of the project’s own making.  </p><p>In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, male writers\\nused women’s names in order to publish certain types of fiction viewed as,\\nwell, unmanly. Women authors often reverted to anonymity rather than\\npseudonymity – for example by publishing work as “by A Lady”. (The first\\nedition of Frankenstein in 1818 was\\npublished anonymously, with Mary Shelley’s name first appearing in the second\\nedition of 1821.)  It is indisputably the\\ncase that women writers were frequently marginalized, patronized and dismissed\\nas frivolous, and for that reason –  but\\nnot only that reason – chose a male pen name.

Courtesy the Busy Beaver Button Museum, Chicago, and Hake’s Auctions, York, Pennsylvania </p><p>In August 2017, a few weeks before the fall semester began at Cornell University, I received an email inviting me to participate in a campaign called “I’m First!” The idea was to encourage “faculty and staff on campus to identify themselves, via T-shirt or button, as the first in their family to graduate from a four-year institution.” The rationale for this themed costume party was the following: “This visual campaign will allow first-generation students to clearly identify (and connect with) faculty and professional staff that have had similar experiences as them!” Though I have been a tenured professor at Cornell for eleven years, neither of my parents, who are French, pursued post-secondary education. My father finished high school; my mother learned stenography at a vocational school and got her first job at sixteen. I guess this made me an ideal candidate to wear the nice T-shirt provided by the administration. But I declined. I’m not ashamed of my background, and I don’t underestimate the challenges students face when they are the first in their family to attend college. But the two occurrences of the verb “to identify” in one eight-line paragraph were clear hints that the I’m First! initiative—part of a national campaign—was pushing a new social identity: “first-gen.”</p><p>The next fall, a long article in the Cornell magazine Ezra featured administrators attesting to the remarkable progress of this new identity. Judging by their comments, first-gen persons would no longer need a button: their nature was now self-evident. One administrator spoke of the difficulty for first-generation students of “walking onto a college campus and maybe not seeing someone who looks like you.” Another suggested that the same students “benefit from having spaces in which to be themselves; to see leadership staff, other students and even artworks that look like them.” I wondered: Do I look first-gen enough? Is it okay if I wear a bow tie or a skirt? Should I speak loudly or be shy? More seriously, what if art or education are, in my view, valuable precisely as a way of becoming other? If I defy expectations, am I untrue to myself, or to the manufactured self that others think I should reclaim? The collection of presumed tastes, behaviors, desires, aspirations, and appearances that come with an externally defined identity rejects in advance anyone who doesn’t conform. “Intersectionality”—or bearing several identities simultaneously—does not change this conundrum; it simply adds additional prescriptions.</p><p>It goes without saying that what happens on my campus1\\n is in no way unique and that being a first-gen is only one relatively novel option in a continuously growing list of what every one of us is supposed to be. American academia is a hotbed of proliferating identities supported and largely shaped by the higher ranks of administrators, faculty, student groups, alumni, and trustees. Not all identities are equal in dignity, history, or weight. Race, gender, and sexual orientation were the three main dimensions of what in the 1970s began to be called identity politics. These traits continue to be key today. But affirmed identities are mushrooming. The slightest shared characteristic, once anchored in a narrative of pain, can give rise to a new group. There is now a rural identity, a peanut-allergic identity, a fat identity, an ADHD identity, and so on. Each comes with stories of humiliation or of life-threatening experiences, with demands for official recognition, with products specifically targeted to the group, and with the sort of people the writer Touré called, in Who’s Afraid of Post-Blackness?, “the self-appointed identity cops.” Whereas identity politics, as theorized four decades ago, aimed to liberate the oppressed and to oppose American capitalism, its main form today is more invested in changing the direction of domination and in multiplying restrictions. It is the social order of the day, its rhetoric ubiquitous in the neurotic centers of the American economy (universities, the media, the tech sector).</p><p>Under this regime, identities, once affirmed, are indisputable. If I say, “As an x, I think. . . ,” I am no longer voicing an opinion that can be evaluated or critiqued within a shared space of discourse; I am merely saying what I am. If you disagree with me, you may trace everything I say back to my identity before availing yourself of corresponding counterarguments: you say a because you are an x, but I am a y and I therefore believe in b. Such identities, I insist, are not emancipatory, neither at the psychological nor at the political level. We all should have the right to evade identification, individually and collectively. What’s more, identity politics as now practiced does not put an end to racism, sexism, or other sorts of exclusion or exploitation. Ready-made identities imprison us in stereotyped narratives of trauma. In short, identity determinism has become an additional layer of oppression, one that fails to address the problems it clumsily articulates.</p><p>The driving force behind the new rise of identity determinism is trivial: social media. Our willing accommodation of the flattening logic that makes complex social life tractable to computer algorithms, the constant mental reshaping to which we subject ourselves through instant communication and individualized mass media, and the profitability of selling data generated by internet users have all contributed to the success of identity politics. Rigid, constantly reenacted identities have become a new law of the market, one whose grip extends offline. The most powerful digital platforms are made for monologues or rants that elicit mechanical expressions of approval or disapproval. This type of electronic elocution is fundamentally self-centered, but the I seeking to grab attention must connect to a we in order to survive and thrive. This we is formed of the crudest commonalities, and it is, so to speak, automatic: sustained by knee-jerk reactions, memes, and viral behaviors driven by the basest stimuli. These responses are personal in the way one “personalizes” a phone or a computer, by selecting one of the few options that engineers have allowed you. The most powerful instrument of social prescription is in the hands of every soliloquist who posts on Facebook or Twitter a demand for silencing some other we. The ability for each mechanized soul to exert a miniature tyranny is daunting enough online. Offline, it has undermined institutions and given us President Donald Trump. More and more, the political realm transcribes social media’s logic of identity. This goes for the white supremacy at the core of Trumpism as well as for the identity-based clientelism of mainstream Democrats.</p><p>With their official emphasis on open-ended scholarly discussion, universities should offer a counterpoint. But American academia tends to align itself with the business world, and corporations cater to the perceived needs of their customers. In colleges, such accommodations may begin with the exclusion of dissenting voices under the pretext of protecting certain identity groups—such as by passing over works that run counter to their supposed interests. The next step is to prevent dialogue in the classroom by forbidding students to talk (this is the traditional, magisterial approach) or avoiding all conflicts and contradictions among participants, thereby confusing a college seminar with an AA meeting. (The move toward online instruction during the pandemic has encouraged professorial monologues, since the technology isn’t conducive to spontaneous discussion.) The last stage involves censoring the name of censorship. When an NYU graduate launched a petition in 2017 titled “Metropolitan Museum of Art: Remove Balthus’ Suggestive Painting of a Pubescent Girl, Thérèse Dreaming,” she insisted she was not demanding censorship (as if the latter were only a synonym for physical destruction). During the Q&A after a talk I gave last November, a university lecturer told me that “there is no cancel culture,” thereby attempting to cancel “cancel.”</p><p>It is hard to determine whether most professors, students, and administrators sincerely subscribe to current identity politics. It varies by campus, discipline, and professional role (administrators certainly tend to express their support for the new order of things). But I do know that, at Cornell and elsewhere, only a negligible minority dares to dissent publicly. This stands in sharp contrast with the initial wave of political correctness, in the mid to late 1990s, when dozens of books written by academics critiqued identity politics from Marxist, conservative, liberal, and queer perspectives. When four Columbia undergraduates wrote an op-ed in 2015 titled our identities matter in core classrooms, they were simply spelling out the majority opinion on campus. Identities matter in the classroom, and to many they are what should matter most. The students made the case for trigger warnings by pointing out that “transgressions concerning student identities are common” in the core curriculum. The Metamorphoses, they explained,</p><p>like so many texts in the Western canon . . . contains triggering and offensive material that marginalizes student identities in the classroom. These texts, wrought with histories and narratives of exclusion and oppression, can be difficult to read and discuss as a survivor, a person of color, or a student from a low-income background.</p><p>There are three interlinked ideas here. The first is that, depending on one’s own identity, one should be coddled when encountering texts (or more generally, artworks or experiences) that could be harmful. (I particularly appreciate the absolutely condescending suggestion that a low-income student is going to be hurt by classical literature.) The logical culmination of trigger warnings is a right to opt out before having any contact with the work, which undermines the whole project of education. Second, the students seem to suppose that they are asked to “read and discuss as” members of a group. This might unfortunately be the case in more and more classes, but it is incompatible with the task of interpretation in the humanities, where we should always remain capable of being touched, challenged, and above all changed by the object of study. A cardinal error when dealing with works of art or thought is to suppose that they are monolithic and in one (ideological) piece. Some are, but they’re usually the uninteresting ones, relics often of a tradition force-fed to students in the name of some correctness. For a long time, the goal was the fostering of national identities; our era is more attuned to social engineering and moral piety, with a touch of old-fashioned puritanism. Third, the students assert that “so many texts in the Western canon” are “offensive.” This is a baffling claim. In all the textual traditions I know, violence is expressed and emotions are triggered, one way or the other. A little more intellectual humility might be useful for a small group of Ivy League students in the twenty-first century presuming to determine what is acceptable in an ancient Greek tragedy, a Tang poem, or a traditional izibongo. It’s striking also that, of all the “Western” authors studied in Columbia’s core curriculum, Ovid was the center of such attacks. The Metamorphoses unfolds a theoretical argument alongside its mythological content: it insists on the crucial role of transformation. This was not exactly a majority opinion in an empire obsessed with fostering stability and what would later be named Romanitas (or “Roman identity,” if you like). Appearing as a character in Ovid’s poem, the philosopher Pythagoras asserts that “all things change.” Ovid’s point is precisely that this principle of metamorphosis shatters any rule of identity, which makes his writings incompatible with the current reverence for reified quiddities.</p><p>In 2016, English majors at Yale asked that a course on “major poets” such as Shakespeare, T. S. Eliot, and Louise Glück no longer be mandatory. Their petition stated that</p><p>a year spent around a seminar table where the literary contributions of women, people of color and queer folks are absent actively harms all students, regardless of their identity, [but is] especially hostile to students of color.</p><p>Beyond the dubious equation of bodies of texts with the bodies of their authors and what they did with them, Shakespeare’s sonnets are anything but a promotion of male heteronormativity, T. S. Eliot’s abstinence looks quite close to the asexual label included in the acronym LGBTQIA+, and Louise Glück is a woman. This January, a revamping of survey classes in art history was presented by the Yale Daily News as</p><p>the latest response to student uneasiness over an idealized Western ‘canon’—a product of an overwhelmingly white, straight, European and male cadre of artists.</p><p>In a comic mode, you may remember the 2015 banh mi affair, when there was a brief controversy over whether a version of the Vietnamese sandwich served at Oberlin College was a symptom of cultural appropriation and a dire blow to the integrity of Asian identities on campus. (Like virtually every other national food staple, such as “Japanese” sushi, “American” hamburgers, or “Italian” pasta in tomato sauce, the banh mi, whose name derives from the French pain de mie, is itself the result of culinary and cultural mixing.) A less laughable incident was the formal complaint filed against Laurie Sheck in 2019 by some of her students at the New School, after she focused in class on the discrepancy between the title I Am Not Your Negro, used by Raoul Peck for his documentary about James Baldwin, and Baldwin’s original wording of the sentence. That Sheck would herself read the so-called N-word aloud—that she would justify it as pedagogically useful—was enough to prompt an inquiry that could have led to her dismissal. (The New School cleared her of wrongdoing.)</p><p>Less prominent cases abound. In a literature class at Stanford, a colleague who wished to devote a session to Toni Morrison was challenged by several undergraduates who argued that a white faculty member should refrain from teaching work by an African-American writer. Having noticed a few years ago that most students in my classes stopped participating when we covered the history of slavery in eighteenth-century Saint-Domingue and the origins of the Haitian Revolution, I was told in private by white students that they felt they shouldn’t speak on such issues in front of black students. I pointed out to them that it was no more moral to remain silent and let the black students bear the burden of discussion. A Cornell colleague used the word “blow job” in a guest lecture he gave for a seminar on the subject of pleasure last spring; he learned in January that a now-dismissed complaint had been lodged against him by a student who considered the term derogatory to women (who, by the way, are not the only people who perform fellatio).</p><p>Formal complaints of this sort rarely have spectacular consequences, though the anxiety of being called out, the stress of public shaming, even over frivolous grievances, at best wastes one’s time and at worst leaves a permanent stain on one’s reputation. But I don’t believe that the goal is actually the removal of professors. The objective is to reach a system of self-censorship that would bind everyone in the room, eroding academic freedom. If the choice of our words, ideas, positions, and texts is conditioned by volatile mobs, if entire sets of questions are now off-limits in our classrooms, books, or labs, then we will no longer have the capacity to create or contest.</p><p>In many of these cases, naturally, the villain is a dead or old white, straight, cisgender male. Yet, a few months after the Ovid affair, a freshman at Duke University explained that he would not read Alison Bechdel’s graphic memoir Fun Home, which had been assigned to all first-year students, because he considered its depictions of same-sex relations “pornography” and contradictory to his Christian “beliefs and identity.” He quoted a thank-you note from a Muslim sophomore who told him, “I’ve seen a lot of people who just throw away their identity in college in the name of secularism, open-mindedness, or liberalism.” Modern partisans of subaltern identities might be upset to see their favorite maneuver deployed by a white male Christian student in the South. Such turnabout should not come as a surprise. Stormfront, the largest English-language online forum for neo-Nazis and white supremacists, promotes “true diversity” and the interests of the “new, embattled, White minority.” White straight males are already a minority in the United States (though one that enjoys disproportionate representation in power). For many voters, Trump’s affirmation of a wounded white identity is central to his appeal, and, unfortunately, to that of his likely successors.</p><p>It should be obvious that identity determinism is by no means a prerogative of the left, for two main reasons. First, a truly leftist position cannot subordinate the goal of collective and individual emancipation to the unconditional affirmation of a set commonality. The identities on offer often resemble varieties of what Marxists used to call “alienation,” in which individuals internalize premade representations of themselves that limit their freedom. Second, many pleas for the protection and promotion of harmed identities now emanate from the right. The two camps may be opposed on policy, but, more and more, they agree that identities should anchor politics. In her book Uncivil Agreement, the political scientist Lilliana Mason argues that Democrat and Republican are no longer ideological positions but rather identities. This is hardly democratic progress. Coupled with ubiquitous surveillance, heightened censorship, digital conformism, and educational failure, the monomania of political identity leaves the people powerless by making cooperation impossible. In such a regime, the shredding of the social fabric is inevitable.</p><p>It is worth noting that the manifesto signed in 1977 by the Combahee River Collective—the text that launched the initial theory and practice of identity politics—warned against both “separatism” and “fractionalization.” This year, Barbara Smith, one of the members of the collective, reflected on her early years of activism, saying: “We absolutely did not mean that we would work with people who were only identical to ourselves. We did not mean that.” She added that, in this respect, the way identity politics has “been used in the last couple of decades is very different than what we intended.” Back in 1989, Shane Phelan wrote the first book with the phrase “identity politics” in its title. The book ended with the following:</p><p>Identity politics must be based not only on identity, but on the appreciation of politics as the art of living together. Politics that ignores our identities, that makes them “private,” is useless, but non-negotiable identities will enslave us whether they are imposed from within or without.</p><p>Are such warnings still audible? Or do we prefer the compartmentalized world of identity mongers preaching to their own crowds and censoring their “natural” adversaries?</p><p>There is a tired objection to what I’ve written so far: that only people enjoying a dominant position could imagine escaping identity—that only they have that luxury, not the powerless people who endure daily suffering and microaggressions, especially at the hands of heteronormative, cisgender, structurally racist, and ableist men. Not quite. Let us remember, for instance, how Ralph Ellison, in Invisible Man (1952), Percival Everett, in Erasure (2001), or Reginald Shepherd, in a 2003 essay satirizing “identity poetics,” are critical, in different ways, of identity determinism without ever trying to efface their social, racial, political, or sexual inscriptions. At the end of Ellison’s novel, the narrator comes to understand “the beautiful absurdity of . . . American identity,” which leaves few other options to members of this society beyond being “blind” (as virtually all characters are portrayed, whatever their race or sex might be) or being “invisible” (like the protagonist). Erasure centers on a writer who, throughout his life, has been considered “not black enough” and rejects the very expressions “my people” and “your people.” Shepherd writes that “the impulse to explain poetry as a symptom of its author” is “a form of self-imprisonment.”</p><p>We are now so used to the association of identity claims with descriptions of harm that any questioning of the reigning ideology is assumed to come from a place of immense privilege. Yet if I wished to portray myself as disadvantaged by current standards, I could do so on at least five counts. But don’t expect me to play the scripted role of the victim. Those of us who have suffered socially for conditions we had no control over—that is, the majority of us—should not be entrapped a second time and forced to think of ourselves as defined by harm. I have been ridiculed, derided, insulted, injured, and beaten, and all that forms part of my life history. But I also have, much as any of us has, the choice of being neither defined nor contained by idiotic brutality. Have I, since childhood, been insulted with epithets such as faggot, cocksucker, and girl? Yes—though French vocabulary is even more colorful. Have I been ridiculed for being too white, owing to the paleness caused by my chronic asthma? Yes, and incidentally this abuse always came from white people, including far-right extremists. Was I bullied in elementary and middle school by other kids for being fat? Yes, I gained weight after recovering from a near-fatal case of hepatitis at age eight, and the hassle lasted for five years. Have I been bullied for other reasons? Oh yes, many: because I sucked at sports, because my parents were poor, because I did well in school, and so on. In my fifteen years in the United States, I have never gone a week without someone frowning when reading my name or asking me to repeat what I just said, as if I were unable to order a single-shot espresso in English. I have lost track of the number of times colleagues have complained that I am a weirdo, decidedly not American, not visible enough as an LGBT person. I am fine with all these statements (I am weird, I don’t hold U.S. citizenship, I don’t want to look a certain way), but they weren’t intended as words of praise. Such aggressions were real, and they were tied to a whole array of political oppressions based on gender, class, sexual orientation, skin color, mental and physical ability. None of them were fortuitous or unrelated to social circumstances. But even in elementary school, I understood that I did not have to swallow the venom or waste my life spitting it back in the face of others. My reactions have varied, but my line is simple: I am not looking for external validation. I simply refuse to identify. I am not going to dispute wrongful characterizations, and I will not apologize either. This method protects more against microaggressions than separatism or celebrations of identity ever could.</p><p>Nothing programmed me to become who I am. In fact, nothing is programming any of us. True, many things constrain us. All systems of political inequality narrow the choices of those who lie at the bottom. We should work tirelessly to overcome such limitations. But as soon as we believe that social circumstances are absolute determinations—or, worse, “what we are”—we condemn ourselves to the endless repetition of the past and to the methodical destruction of new possibilities. While emancipation cannot be achieved only through education, the latter is, quite clearly, indispensable. The free pursuit of knowledge cannot be an afterthought: neither teaching nor research should be defined a priori by the twenty-first-century catechism of political identities. Freeing oneself from the given is an unending process that lies at the core of higher education. This task concerns students and professors alike, who should constantly allow themselves to be altered by different concepts, poems, people, and events. In contrast, today’s identity politics is a false promise that is imposed on us, often in spaces of relative intellectual freedom. No university worthy of that name, and indeed no democracy worthy of that name, should urge people to retreat within the brackets of their identities. Living, thinking, dreaming, and creating are not about what we are, but who we might become.</p><p> is a professor of comparative literature, Romance studies, and cognitive science at Cornell University.</p><p>I’m speaking on behalf of myself, not Cornell, of course, though I support wholeheartedly the school’s motto, “Any person, any study.” A person is not an identity.</p>\",\"date\":\"2020-8-18\",\"link\":\"https://harpers.org/archive/2020/09/nonconforming/\",\"discrp\":\"Academia is a hotbed of proliferating identities and packaged narratives.

Both mentions of the film occur in the midst of Knausgaard’s epic tangent on Hitler’s autobiography and the rise of National Socialism in Europe.</p><p>The first comes during a discussion of the conversion of Martin Heidegger and other German intellectuals to Nazism. Quoting a German journalist on how Nazism provided a “widespread feeling of deliverance, of liberation from democracy,” Knausgaard indicates the sense we can get of “this aspect of the Third Reich—the popular demonstrations, the torchlit parades, the songs, the sense of community, all of which were unconditional joys to anyone who participated—by watching Riefenstahl’s films of the Nuremberg Rally… where all these elements are present.” Precisely because Riefenstahl’s film was so meticulously staged, Knausgaard alleges, it is striking how its “content far eclipses the fact, because emotions are stronger than all analyses, and here the emotions are set free. This is not politics, but something beyond. And it is something good.”</p><p>Knausgaard does not mean “good” in the moral sense. He refers to the feelings of the people involved in the marches and parades. As he does throughout the four-hundred page section, Knausgaard attempts to reconstruct the thoughts and emotions of those who were attracted to National Socialism, under the principle that it is impossible to understand the emergence of Nazism—“the last major utopian movement in the west”—without understanding what moved the people of Germany, and later of other European countries, to embrace it. And what moved them, in Knausgaard’s view, was not the Nazis’ promise to redistribute income, or Hitler’s analysis of world affairs, or even, initially, their hatred of the Jews. What moved them was, rather, the joyful feeling of togetherness and community, of being able to transcend not only the fragmented democracy of the Weimar period but politics altogether.</p><p>“In National Socialism,” writes Knausgaard, “philosophy and politics come together at a point outside the language, and beyond the rational, where all complexity ceases, though not all depth.” Riefenstahl’s film communicates the pleasure the people experienced—how “good” it felt to them—at having escaped the quotidian chaos of their shabby republic and their trivial private lives, at being liberated from the restrictions of rationality and deliberation, at being on the brink of achieving something large and lasting, deep and simple.</p><p>A similar focus on the emotional wellsprings of Nazi politics is evident in an important but largely overlooked recent film, which opens with black and white footage from Triumph of the Will. At the beginning of Terrence Malick’s A Hidden Life, we see—in lieu of opening credits—images of Hitler in the open cockpit of a plane descending through the mist as he lands for the rally in Nuremberg, Hitler standing before a teeming square of Nazis in neat lines, Hitler riding in his cavalcade through the streets. The film then shifts abruptly to the mountain town of Sankt Radegund, in the Austrian countryside, which appears at first to exist in total isolation from the opening tableau.</p><p>Against a backdrop of green hills and blue skies, we are introduced to Franz, a farmer and father, along with his mother, his wife, Fani, and their three young daughters. There are no military parades in Radegund, and, in the consciousness of the farmers, there seems to be hardly any politics. Fani’s and Franz’s lives are consumed by their faith, their work on the land, and their family. They live in what appears to be a fairytale innocence.</p><p>The fairytale ends when Fani is shown looking skyward, alarmed at the sound of planes buzzing overhead. The war has arrived, and Franz is soon sent to a training camp for the German army. At the military camp, Franz watches quizzically as the recruits are shown filmed images—projected on an outdoor screen—of Nazis marching victoriously through foreign cities in flames. But the propaganda has the opposite of the effect it is supposed to have on Franz. When he is called to fight again, Franz informs the recruiters that he won’t go. Later, he resolves not to serve Hitler in any way.</p><p>Based on the life and letters of Franz Jägerstätter, a farmer born in Radegund in 1907, later beatified by the Catholic Church, the character cites his faith in God and his love for Fani as his inspirations for refusing to do what everyone around him does without exception and, in most cases, without hesitation. When asked to articulate his reasons, he says little; when challenged with the fact that his resistance will “change nothing,” he merely nods. Offered a chance to avoid military service if only he will sign an oath of loyalty to Hitler, Franz refuses. He is taken from his wife, mother, and daughters, then imprisoned, tortured, and eventually executed. In Radegund, his family is outcast from the community and deprived of wartime rations.</p><p>Some critics of A Hidden Life have bemoaned the film’s lack of historical detail, pointing out that hardly anything is said about concentration camps or about the intricate political circumstances that prepared the way for Nazism. According to The New Yorker’s Richard Brody, Malick uses Nazi Germany “emblematically,” as a merely metaphorical backdrop to “illustrate the ultimate clash of good and evil, the ultimate price of resistance.” Likewise, The New York Times’s A.O. Scott lamented that Nazism is “depicted a bit abstractly, a matter of symbols and attitudes and stock images rather than specifically mobilized hatreds.” These criticisms not only miss Malick’s point, they invert it.</p><p>Malick, like Knausgaard, thematizes the “symbols and attitudes” of Nazism because he perceives how central these were to the appeal of Nazism itself. The film demonstrates impressionistically what Knausgaard, with his characteristic thoroughness, lays out in voluminous excerpts of diary entries and contemporaneous accounts from the period: the “goodness” of Nazism was as much about its symbols and attitudes as it was about its policies and actions. But the appeal A Hidden Life makes as an artistic experience is the opposite of symbolic. For the contemporary viewer, the film’s power flows from the fact that, whatever political and social convulsions led to the moment when Fani cranes her neck skyward, individual Germans like Franz and Fani were confronted by a choice that remains perfectly legible today.</p><p>Some at the time may not have felt Nazism to be a choice at all. History nevertheless records that there were, without any doubt, resisters. The existence of these resisters has “proved crucial to establishing a kind of ex post facto moral compass,” writes Rand Richards Cooper in Commonweal magazine, “reminding Germans—rather in the way that the witness of passionate nineteenth-century abolitionists reminds Americans regarding slavery—that a point of moral sanity was in fact visible to some, and thus available to all.”</p><p>How does Franz achieve this moral sanity? That is the central question of A Hidden Life, and it is in how he addresses it that Malick’s critics find special cause for complaint. Scott, at the end of his review, confesses that his incomprehension of Franz’s motives may be related to his personal preference for “historical and political insight over matters of art and spirit.” It is refreshing to hear a critic be so honest about their intellectual biases. It is also revealing of the assumptions that seem to pervade the broader discussion in recent years—carried on mostly by academics and op-ed writers, as opposed to artists—about the relationship between the politics of 1930s Europe and those of our own time. But what if the capacity to appreciate the relevance of Nazism to our own time is, in fact, inseparable from our willingness to attend seriously to “matters of art and spirit”?</p><p>Knausgaard finished his novel—and Malick likely started working on his film—well before Trump took office, so it is misleading to think of their artworks as “responses” to the events of the past four years. Nevertheless, and partly for that reason, they offer a useful vantage point from which we can evaluate not only our own relation to that past, but also the limitations of the intellectual tools we have tended to turn to when trying to articulate that relation.</p><p>Beginning not long after the 2016 election with the historian Timothy Snyder’s bestseller Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century (2017), soon followed by the philosopher Jason Stanley’s How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them (2018), numerous scholars have sought to use historical analysis of the Weimar period to alert Americans to the early signs of fascistic rule. As the Trump presidency has dragged on, these urgent warnings have given way to a wide-ranging debate, including in these pages, about whether such historical analogies are warranted or appropriate.</p><p>Understood in relation to that debate, Malick’s and Knausgaard’s artistic treatments of Nazism may persuade us not of the inaccuracy or inappropriateness of such analogies, but of their utter and complete futility—at least insofar as it is claimed such comparisons can inoculate us against repetition. In their focus on the emotional pull of Nazism—its promise to liberate citizens from the frustrations and banalities of an alienated, lonely existence, to connect them with a mass of like-minded souls in “unconditional joy”—the works of Malick and Knausgaard expose us to aspects of how fascism works that it would be laughable to think could yield to academic analysis, no matter how accessibly arranged.</p><p>“Establish a private life,” warns Snyder. “Listen for dangerous words.” Do we really imagine it was advice such as this that interwar Germans lacked?</p><p>The second time Triumph of the Will comes up in Book Six of My Struggle, Knausgaard reflects that “Nazi Germany was the absolute state. It was the state its people could die for.”</p><p>Watching Riefenstahl’s film of the rallies in Nuremberg, its depiction of people almost paradisiac in its unambiguousness, converged upon the same thing, immersed in the symbols, the callings from the deepest pith of human life, that which has to do with birth and death, and with homeland and belonging, one finds it splendid and unbearable at the same time, though increasingly unbearable the more one watches, at least this was how I felt when I watched it one night this spring, and I wondered for a long time where that sense of the unbearable came from, the unease that accompanied these images of the German paradise, with its torches in the darkness, the intactness of its medieval city, its cheering crowds, its sun, and its banners… [and] I came to the conclusion… that it came… from something in the images themselves, the sense being that the world they displayed was an unbearable world.</p><p>Once again, the emphasis is on the affective allure of this “paradisiac” world, the pleasure that is involved in sublimating one’s individual will to the mythic collective. To make one feel justified in dying for one’s country is, in some sense, the greatest gift a country can bestow on an individual. And yet Knausgaard, watching the film as an adult in a liberal democracy more than seventy years later, finds it “unbearable.” What is it in this world—or, more precisely, in “these images” of it—that are so unbearable to Knausgaard?</p><p>One of the chief insights yielded by Knausgaard’s close reading of Mein Kampf is that Hitler, for all his vehement disgust with modernity, was “one of us.” He was modern and Western in the sense that he was secular yet wanted some larger meaning; modern and Western insofar as he craved something that the rationalized, bureaucratic nation-state is organized to exclude. To say that Knausgaard arrived at this insight by making an analogy between Hitler’s time and our own would be to miss its force, for the analogy presumes a distance requiring some leap of imagination—or historical scholarship—in order to bridge it. In fact, no such distance exists.</p><p>At the dawn of the twentieth century, Knausgaard recounts, large portions of Western high society “closed the door” on religion, while millions were uprooted from their communities and traditions, often settling in overcrowded cities teeming with poverty, exploitation and, soon, militarism. If we can only clear our eyes of self-serving fantasies, Knausgaard believes, we will see that we are still living, spiritually if not quite synchronously, in that century, and that its problems are still our problems. Among the largest of these is how individuals cut off from religion and tradition can satisfy their craving for meaning and transcendence, how they may connect with that “deepest pith” of human life.</p><p>Knausgaard acknowledges the salience of this problem, and also the ugliness of the ways many modern societies have endeavored to solve it. His artistic project in My Struggle may be viewed, in one respect, as an argument for art, rather than politics, as the proper place to explore the transcendent. Throughout the six volumes, Knausgaard strives to make contact with the “inexhaustible” feelings—feelings he associates with experiences of joy, beauty, plenitude, ecstasy, and reverence—that he believes are suppressed in so much of modern, secular life. In Book Six, he emphasizes that these emotions are also at work in Riefenstahl’s film, and that they speak to some of the elemental forces that drove Nazi ideology. But whereas Riefenstahl intentionally blurs the line between aesthetic feelings and political ones, Knausgaard insists on the necessity of segregating them. In contrast to the undifferentiated masses that populate Riefenstahl’s “German paradise,” the responsible modern artist anchors their artistic vision in distinctive personal experience, which they invest with what Knausgaard calls “the inimitable tone of the particular.”</p><p>But even within art, Knausgaard argues, the Nazi experiment has had its effect. So complete was the catastrophe of Nazism that it warns us not only against the danger of utopianism in politics, but also against the danger of utopianism in any collective cultural endeavor, including art. Knausgaard laments the extent to which Western art after Nazism has been oriented toward ideas (the cerebral, the critical) rather than toward the emotions (the passionate, the inexpressible), but his novel, about the life of a bourgeois man raising his family, demonstrates that even he does not wish completely to disavow this orientation. Indeed, as many critics have noted, Knausgaard surrounds his musings on the transcendent with thousands of pages documenting a man making cereal, tidying his children’s bedrooms, checking his email, and agonizing over whether he should get off the couch to make another cup of tea.</p><p>The prosaicness of My Struggle is, in this light, an act of prudence and self-limitation: while expressing his perennial attraction to the “inexhaustible” emotions, Knausgaard never forgets their danger. The long digression on Hitler—the culmination of Knaugaard’s book-length Kampf against what he takes to be his own Hitlerian impulses—ends with Knausgaard’s remembering the moment he felt most powerfully the stirrings of the “we” he associates with fascism: in the aftermath of Anders Breivik’s summer camp mass shooting outside of Oslo in 2011.</p><p>This “we” emerged amid a moment of national mourning and grief, and yet Knausgaard still perceives in it the germ of a potentially fascist collectivity. Even sitting alone, as he writes the final portion of his book from his home office in Malmö, a medium-sized city in Sweden, where he lives with his wife and his (then) three children, Knausgaard recognizes in himself a desire he identifies with Nazism: to reach beyond the dull comforts and tedious complications of bourgeois democratic life. But he also knows something the Germans marching in Riefenstahl’s film did not know, and this thing compels him to resist this desire, as it relates to politics and even to art.</p><p>What makes Riefenstahl’s film unbearable to Knausgaard is that he knows the catastrophic endpoint of the joyful, torchlit parade. We might even say My Struggle in its entirety is an investigation of the liberal-democratic self—in its nobility as well as in its banality—that has been shaped by the knowledge of where Hitler’s parade of the “we” ends.</p><p>Malick, too, knows where this parade ends, yet he comes to a conclusion different from Knausgaard’s about how art might be meaningful after Auschwitz. In a review that chided the film for its “heavy-handed moralism,” the critic Lidija Haas observed that it was “hard to tell whether it’s an intentional irony” that Malick begins A Hidden Life by showing a “fantasia” of a mountain community that a “fascist would adore.” I don’t see anything ironic about it, but Malick’s romantic evocation of life in the mountains, in a movie that begins with footage from Riefenstahl, could hardly be accidental.</p><p>Before her Nazi period, Riefenstahl both starred in and directed a series of “mountain films” that were reputedly admired by Hitler. In these films, wrote Susan Sontag in her famous essay on fascist aesthetics, the “mountain is represented as both supremely beautiful and dangerous, that majestic force which invites the ultimate affirmation of and escape from the self.” A Hidden Life also makes use of a majestic romantic imagery: the mountains shrouded in mist form the backdrop for more than one scene in which a farmer is tilling the fields at dusk. That this imagery is deployed in a film devoted to resistance to Nazism, however, might inspire us to ask whether it is necessary—or wise—to abandon the field of the emotional sublime to the fascists.</p><p>Ever since Walter Benjamin observed, in the epilogue to his much-cited 1935 essay “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” that the logic of fascism was toward “the introduction of aesthetics into political life,” Western artists have gravitated toward one of two paths. Many leftwing artists, suspicious not only of the aestheticization of politics but of any emotional appeal not immediately assimilable to their political purposes, have taken part in a counterattack that culminates, as Benjamin predicted it would, in the full “politicization of art”—that is, the reduction of art to agitprop. Liberals and many conservative writers have, on the other hand, predominantly done as Knausgaard recommended and tried to sequester aesthetics within the artistic sphere, even there taking care not to let things get out of hand.</p><p>An appreciation of the full spiritual force of movements like Nazism might encourage us to countenance a third alternative, one that acknowledged the centrality of symbolism and emotion to political life, and deployed them against the eroticized collectivism that is so evident in Riefenstahl’s film. This aesthetics would honor the triumph, we might say, not of the collective will, that threatening “we,” but of the individual conscience.</p><p>Midway through A Hidden Life is an arresting tableau: Hitler, again in grainy film footage, appears in uniform, playing with a little boy on the viewing deck of his retreat in the Bavarian mountains, the sun glittering off the mountainside behind him. The interlude—beautiful but haunting (haunting because beautiful)—underscores, just as the film’s opening does, the aesthetic and emotional appeal of the Nazi project. Malick does not shrink from this appeal, but neither does he allow it to shrink his own ambition as an artist. In a film that begins with Riefenstahl’s footage, the very worst that can ensue from the politicization of such ambitions is in full view. But A Hidden Life rather than being intimidated into modesty by fascist art, presents a countervailing utopia to the völkisch collectivist one, holding out the prospect of a different kind of “escape from the self.”</p><p>It is not incidental to Franz’s story that, for him, religion is still an open door. Christianity provides both the substance and the inspiration for the orienting world “beyond” politics in A Hidden Life. Of course, as the film depicts, plenty of churchgoing Christians were among Nazism’s most enthusiastic supporters. And conversely, the aesthetic power of Malick’s late films, even as they have grown more explicitly Christian in their imagery and message, is perfectly accessible to many of us who are not Christians. Christianity, in these films, is one among many educators of the moral sentiments, one among many reminders that ethical action is not dependent on “historical and political insight” and often will remain unmoved by it. Art can be another such educator.</p><p>“I have this feeling,” Franz tells the Nazi judge who presides over his trial. “If God gives us free will, we’re responsible for what we do—or what we fail to do. I can’t do what I believe is wrong.” Franz’s belief, like the beliefs of the fascists, is based on a feeling. This why his “resistance” has seemed opaque to those more accustomed to researching and factchecking their way to virtue, but it is precisely what gives his story its relevance in a period in which a new emotional sincerity is spreading throughout our political life, often overpowering our liberal-democratic caution about political passions.</p><p>Yet, in contrast to the fascists, Franz does not clothe his moral feeling in self-certainty; still less does he attempt to transform it into dogmatic judgment. Rather, he accepts that his decision is vulnerable to counterarguments, including those that his wife and lawyer repeatedly put before him. He could be wrong, he acknowledges to the judge, but he cannot sign the oath. It is not only fascist feelings that are, sometimes, inexpressible.</p>\",\"date\":\"2020-8-15\",\"link\":\"https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2020/08/14/the-unbearable-toward-an-antifascist-aesthetic/\",\"discrp\":\"Susan Sontag famously wrote about Leni Riefenstahl and the aesthetics of fascism.

One answer would be to “cancel” him, to dump his statue in some river and let the water erase it. This wouldn’t be without cause: calling his politics and personality repugnant is an understatement. But it would also be too simple. Pound’s fingerprints are everywhere: most famously on The Waste Land, but also on the careers of Yeats, Frost, William Carlos Williams, and H. D. (Hilda Doolittle); on the publication of Joyce’s Ulysses; on Imagism, Vorticism, and the “New Poetry” that emerged in Poetry a century ago. He was, inescapably, one of the pivotal figures of twentieth-century literature.</p><p>If we have to live with Pound, the necessary question is how: merely as a player in literary history or also as the author of literature still worth reading? Two recent—and very different—works offer their own ways of approaching him. Daniel Swift’s The Bughouse: The Poetry, Politics, and Madness of Ezra Pound (2017) guides a popular, if highbrow, readership through the decade Pound was institutionalized at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C.; while Timothy Billings’s Cathay: A Critical Edition (2019), presents a meticulously researched textual guide to the composition of Pound’s 1915 breakthrough of translations (or “translations”) from Chinese poetry.</p><p>The Foreword, Introduction, and Editor’s Introduction to Cathay: A Critical Edition make the case that we should not really read these poems as Pound’s work, per se, but “as a link in a series of compilations, glosses, and creative rewrites,” “textual collaborations” with the original authors and the many figures who mediated Pound’s encounter with them. The narrower (and admitted) goal of this approach is to circumvent the longstanding arguments about Pound’s accuracy and authenticity as a translator and to focus on his textual process of translation—all for the best. But one can’t help noticing another effect: to separate the poetry from the poet, dissolving Pound’s authorship in order to absolve the words.</p><p>Billings performs meticulous, detailed, and traditional textual scholarship: transcribing, annotating, collating. Ultimately, these labors belie the notion that Pound’s singular authorial role could ever have been a merely contingent link in textual transmission.</p><p>Cathay, Swift’s account contends, “invents modernist poetry.” Like all claims about modernism’s origins, this is an overstatement invested in literary mythology. But its point is worthwhile: in their moment, these two dozen translations from classical Chinese poetry (and the Old English “The Seafarer”) weren’t just an obscure work of antiquities. They were living poetry—something new. Of course, translates has always been a contentious verb here: Pound didn’t know much Chinese at all. Instead, he worked from the notebooks Ernest Fenollosa, an American art historian, had used to study with two Japanese scholars, Umewaka Minoru and Mori Kainan.</p><p>For over a century, critics and scholars have argued about Pound’s methods of translating, his errors and his inventions, without careful or systematic reference to the documents from which Pound worked—despite their availability in Yale’s special collections. Billings transcribes and assembles these “cribs” as the back matter to this Cathay, the bulk of the volume. The layout does present a multi-authorial snapshot: First, the Chinese characters themselves; beneath them, the romanji transliteration; then a word-by-word gloss of literal definitions; “paraphrases” offering the sense of the whole line; and, lastly, Pound’s published translation. The five layers repeat, line-by-line, for every poem, emphasizing one of Billings’s more remarkable discoveries: that Pound’s practices of translation grew out of a traditional Japanese reading practice called kundoku, or gloss-reading. It’s a three-stage process that Ernest Fenollosa’s teachers employed: read aloud one line at a time; succinctly parse each character, including multiple meanings; create an intelligible paraphrase, or translation, of the line. The result, in the notebooks, are glosses and paraphrases that often disagree by design. As Pound translated, he erred on the side of the glosses—leading to moments of insight and of error.</p><p>Billings terms Pound’s method of working from these “the calque,” or “a transfer of lexical meanings so ‘literal’ that it imposes its foreignness unidiomatically on the new text.” In the hands of a lesser poet, this could easily be as disastrous as the floridly idiomatic renderings of late-nineteenth century translations Pound both rejected and consulted. In his critique of Richmond Lattimore’s 1967 translation of Homer, “Another Odyssey,” Guy Davenport observes that “Translation involves two languages; the translator is in constant danger of inventing a third that lies between, a treacherous nonexistent language suggested by the original and not recognized by the language into which the original is being transposed.” This is the technique of Pound’s calquing—and it highlights how essential he is to the process. The third line of “Poem by the Bridge at Ten-Shin” reads, in Fenollosa’s gloss, “Morning become cut/rend intestine flowers.” Paraphrased, it’s “In the morning they are unbearably beautiful flowers.” Neither leads inevitably to Pound’s imaginative, unidiomatic, and yet far superior, “At morning these are flowers to cut the heart.”</p><p>The English language may never see another editor quite like him. The same methods he would use to chisel his “Homage to Sextus Propertius” from the Latin, various Cantos from Latin renderings of Homer or the correspondence of Sigismondo Malatesta, or The Waste Land from Eliot’s meandering “He Do the Police in Different Voices” drives his process here. If Cathay really did invent modernism, it was by honing Pound’s editorial prowess. Cathay’s textual history may have been complex and involved the collation of multiple voices, but, inescapably, it is also the work of Pound’s idiosyncratic and erratic genius. </p><p>Billings’s Pound disappears into textual history. Swift’s was never there at all: in The Bug House, the aging, institutionalized poet is a cipher for those who come to visit him at St. Elizabeths. Encounters with his contemporaries (Eliot, William Carlos Williams), rising poets (Elizabeth Bishop, Robert Lowell, Charles Olson, John Berryman, Hugh Seidel), and his doctors guide the structure of Swift’s account of Pound’s decade there—as do other, more ephemeral figures who drift onstage from the neo-fascist margins of American and Italian politics. All find in Pound what they want (and perhaps need) to find: a model of resistance to poetic conventions, an antagonist, a mentor, an elder poet also grappling with madness; a celebrity patient; an economic and political theorist whose works root out a global conspiracy of usurists (Jews, capitalists, militarists, mongrelizers, and more Jews). Insofar as it offers these narrative snapshots of a moment in literary history, this has value: Pound serving less as a forebear than as an object of cultural significance in the 1950s, like Ozymandias’s pedestal come to life, or the ruined Lady Liberty in Planet of the Apes.</p><p>But Swift frames his study as his own attempt to visit with Pound—and as ours. “Pound at St. Elizabeths is the riddle at the heart of the twentieth century,” he writes; “Pound’s contradictions remain with us. They are the uncertainties of our time.” But after 260 pages, Swift can reach no answer. Pound is contradictory. He (and his verse) probably can’t be trusted, but also can’t be dismissed. The book’s closing image is Pound, free in 1959, waiting for the director of a BBC documentary to tell him what to do: a figure whose meaning must be created by someone else. Pound is always only what we make of him.</p><p>This is the worst of all worlds: a way of accidentally absolving Pound of his sins while dismissing the poetry as at best secondary to the empty vessel of his biography. Swift makes the same mistake many of Pound’s guests did: he visits and expects to learn something. Nearly a century after the New Criticism excised author and context from consideration, we’ve come full circle, subordinating poetry to psychology, politics, and personality. This isn’t Swift’s fault; it’s the condition both of much of what passes for literary criticism and our contemporary notion of poetry as mere “self-expression,” a way to be “heard” in all your “individuality.”</p><p>But if we’re to be totally honest, Swift’s relegation of the poetry to minimal importance isn’t entirely wrong. Much of Pound’s work—including almost all of the Cantos—simply are not worth reading or investing the time and resources of scholarship. Arguments about Pound’s politics often seem like ways to skirt the question of his literary merit. We know he’s important—but is he any good?</p><p>So let’s speak plainly. Pound was a central figure of twentieth-century literary history, without whom lasting, enduring works would not have taken the shapes they did. He was a talented, innovative poet—up until his mid-thirties. But the Cantos, on which he staked his reputation, were a failure. The modernist scholar Lawrence Rainey referred to them as “The Monument of Culture.” The truth is that they were born ruins. To find beauty in them, we have to do something like what Pound did in Cathay: read the word-by-word glosses and ignore the paraphrases. The reason is this: when we do try to make sense of them, they descend too often into secrecy, paranoia, and conspiracy. It’s not that there’s no “there” there—it’s that what is there far too often isn’t worthwhile.</p><p>Pound will endure, though, because in any honest literary history he must. The poems will, too—at least some of them, the early translations like Cathay especially. Billings’s scholarship makes the case for that—and for “The Seafarer,” “Homage to Sextus Propertius,” and the first Canto. Despite the ugliness of his person, some of what Pound created remains lastingly beautiful.  </p><p>J. L.

There is little disagreement about the events of the Viking Age or its timeline, stretching from 8 June 793 (the unexpected raid on Lindisfarne) to 25 September 1066, when King Haraldr Harðráði, ‘Hard-Counsel Harald’, died at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. As Neil Price points out, all this should be seen as protohistory rather than history. The Vikings themselves couldn’t write, except for short runic inscriptions carved in wood or stone, and had no dating system beyond ‘the fourth year of King Olaf’ and so on. Royal succession was the only way to mark time. The sequence of events we refer to as the Viking Age was put together from the accounts of their many victims, from Ireland to Byzantium.</p><p>Price’s book, however, centres on ‘what made [the Vikings] tick, how they thought and felt’. How much money did they make? How much labour went into fitting out a Viking fleet? What did Vikings think happened to women when they died? (Warriors, of course, went to Valhalla.) There are clues to this last question in excavated Viking graves, but these discoveries – Price is professor of archaeology at Uppsala University – are often inscrutable. There are logistical questions too. In considering the wealth of the Vikings, it’s impossible to ignore the island of Gotland, where hundreds of hoards of silver have been found, almost one for every farm – contributing to a total of more than a million silver dirhams found in Scandinavia and the Baltic, nine times as many as have been found in their point of origin in the Muslim Near East. It’s ‘simply not credible’, Price writes, ‘that virtually all homeowners concealed their family cash in the backyard and then died before telling anyone about it’. Later accounts claim that the Vikings believed they would enjoy their buried wealth in the afterlife. The sources aren’t reliable, but it does at least explain the phenomenon.</p><p>The biggest question, of course, is what made the Vikings so successful for so long. Western Europe was dominated by warlike monarchs and aristocracies, while Muslim Spain, the Byzantine Empire and the Caliphate of Baghdad were all in their different ways organised for warfare. Price suggests that we need a prehistory as well as a protohistory. Two traumatic events affected the northern world long before Lindisfarne. One was the collapse of the Roman Empire, a destabilisation that led to a kind of ‘gangster culture’ of unemployed mercenaries and roving warbands. Even worse, and better evidenced, were the volcanic eruptions of 536, 539/540 and possibly 547. The second, which originated from Ilopango in what is now El Salvador, threw around ninety cubic kilometres of dust, ash and aerosols into the atmosphere. The entire world suffered, but Scandinavia, with its short growing season and often marginal agriculture, suffered most. It’s thought as much as half the population died of starvation. At the heart of Norse mythology is the Fimbulwinter, three winters with no summers in between, which may once have been a fact.</p><p>In desperate circumstances, the poor die but the survivors expand their holdings. The famine may well have strengthened the post-Roman militarised elites who have left their traces in the giant mounds and boat-burials of Uppsala and Valsgärde, and the enormous wooden hall at Borg in Norway, which at 270 feet long is as big as a cathedral. Another hall at Uppsala had door hinges made of spears, their points facing towards the centre, so that you entered through a weapon portal: all part of ‘a dazzling material culture of killing’. But there were few ways to pay for this in the middle of the long post-Roman slump, which entailed the disruption of established markets. Raiding must have looked very attractive.</p><p>Price also notes the significance of the Vikings’ gender imbalance. Norse society was not exactly polygamous, for monogamy was normal, but it was polygynous. Rich men and royalty had wives, subsidiary wives and concubines, sometimes, according to an 11th-century treatise by Adam of Bremen, ‘in unlimited number’. An unbalanced ‘socio-sexual economyʼ was probably made worse by the habit in warlike societies of rearing baby boys more carefully than girls, leading to female infanticide by neglect. Skeleton studies in Sweden show that about 7 per cent of Viking men were malnourished as children, compared to 37 per cent of women. Elite monopolisation and differential survival rates must have created an underclass of what we would now call ‘involuntary celibates’, disaffected young men, angry, desperate and easy to recruit.</p><p>In one of several vignettes, Price imagines a younger son on the impoverished west coast of Norway, whose childhood sweetheart has a new brooch: a present from a boy who spent a successful summer raiding. What is young Orm or Gunnar going to do? Not only does he need money for the bride-price paid to her family, he needs a reputation: ‘The act of acquiring silver was as important as the silver itself.’ And if he went raiding he might in any case acquire a woman for free. DNA has shown that ‘a very large proportion – even the majority – of female settlers in Iceland were of Scottish or Irish heritage.’</p><p>Traumatised societies, militarised elites, disaffected youths: they all help explain the Viking phenomenon. But did they think like us? Price points out that the Vikings decorated everything that had a surface, including themselves. Ibn Fadlan, the Arab traveller who met a party of the blond ‘Rus’ somewhere in Eastern Europe in the 920s – and whose horrifying account of a Viking funeral has been largely confirmed by archaeological finds – said that they were covered in what must have been tattoos. ‘Each man, from the tip of his toes to his neck, is covered in dark green lines, pictures and such like.’ No Viking skin has survived, but their teeth have. It seems there was a male fashion for filing horizontal grooves along the upper incisors, which were probably filled with coloured resin. A Viking smile must have looked very odd. But what the point of this fashion was, we don’t know.</p><p>Nor do we know what they thought about their own inner lives. Vikings recognised hamr, or ‘shape’, as more or less equivalent to ‘body’, though some people were eigi einhamr, ‘not of one shape’: they were werewolves, or worse. Hugr could correspond more or less to ‘mind’. But Vikings also seem to have thought that each of us has a hamingja, a personal ‘luck’, which can on occasion leave the body (a very bad sign). The fourth part of us is a female fylgja, a ‘follower’ or ‘fetch’, inherited from our ancestors. Price doesn’t claim to know what a ‘fetch’ does, but he writes that the belief dies hard. If you ask modern Icelanders whether they believe in elves and the huldufólk or ‘hidden people’, they will roll their eyes, but ask them about their fylgjur and you get ‘a level stare and perhaps a change of subject’.</p><p>Viking society wasn’t homogeneous. They had dealings with many different cultures and they lived in varied environments, from Danish and Swedish pasture to the sub-Arctic tundra of Norway and Iceland. In the early 11th century the best-travelled woman in the world must have been Gudrid Thorbjarnardóttir, whose remarkable journeys demonstrate the great distances the Vikings covered. She gave birth to a child in North America, met people of the First Nations and ate grapes in Vinland, made a pilgrimage to Rome and drank wine in Italy, and died as a nun in Iceland. Vikings lived in close contact with the Sámi people, whom they called Finns. In his earlier book, The Viking Way, Price pointed out that Norwegians and Swedes, at least, might be regarded as in some ways similar to the ‘circumpolar’ cultures which stretch from Greenland to Siberia, notably in what looks like shamanistic behaviour.</p><p>But the more we know about the Vikings, the harder it becomes to say anything certain about them. This applies in particular to the area for which we have most archaeological evidence – burial practices. The number of excavated Viking graves is in the low millions, and the only rule is that they’re all different. Men buried with weapons are common, but the occupant of a particularly well-furnished grave in Birka, who was buried seated with axe, sword, spears, bow and arrows, is now confirmed by DNA as female. Conversely men buried in women’s clothes and with feminine accessories have been found on several occasions, including one man buried with a full set of female jewellery near Andover. Women buried with iron staffs may have been völvur, sorceresses, practitioners of the seithr magic which was shameful for men to deal in. But Odin seems to have been the supreme exponent of just this kind of magic, so some scholars now write about ‘Odin the Queer’. Possibly, as in circumpolar cultures, all the workers of magic and sorcery were regarded as ‘differently gendered’. Shamans have a gender all their own.</p><p>It is hard to come to any overall conclusions about Viking belief from their burial practices. They performed cremation and inhumation, boat burial and barrow burial. In Sweden, birds’ eggs were often placed in cremated ashes. Burying someone with two horses could be a kind of tribute, but why bisect the horses and then swap the halves over? What explains the modest burial which, decades later, had a boat full of bodies placed over it, the keel exactly covering the grave, a ritual repeated with more boats and more men over the years? In Salme, off the coast of Estonia, two boats have been found which appear to contain forty Swedish raiders, buried displaying their battle wounds, clutching fish and birds and cuts of beef or pork. But why throw gaming pieces over them? One sword-carrier has a king placed in his mouth. Was it a mark of derision from the victors or of respect? What to make of ‘a line of burials in which every corpse clasps a smooth white pebble in their hand’? If the eggs in the ashes express hope for a new life, a hatching, then perhaps the white pebbles are symbolic eggs?</p><p>Price avoids such speculation, though we have no good explanations for this astonishing diversity. He is similarly dismissive of the idea that we can reconstruct a belief system from the ‘Norse myths’. Vikings had no accepted scripture, just stories. They had no accepted religion either, just what Price calls ‘religiolects’, differing from one another as dialects differ from a standard language. Archaeology offers harder facts and firmer conclusions in other areas. The silver hoards of Gotland are surprising enough, but they represent only a fraction of the Vikings’ take. It’s thought that as many as 125 million silver dirhams from the Caliphate of Baghdad, some 340 tonnes of metal, went north in the tenth century as payment for furs and slaves. The ninth-century payoffs from the Frankish Empire were much less substantial, but still amounted to around seven million silver pennies, a high proportion of the coins in circulation in impoverished Western Europe. The Vikings made off with ‘approximately 14 per cent of the entire monetary output of the Frankish Empire’, and that isn’t counting other kinds of loot, such as slaves.</p><p>There is also the matter of the expenditure involved in gaining the loot. Viking sails were made of greased wool and it took about fifty sheep to provide the wool for one sail. The wool had to be spun and woven: heavy, co-operative work on a great Viking loom (the ‘Song of the Valkyries’ is in the form of a work song, but the web the Valkyries are weaving from human intestines is war and death). You would be wise to have a spare sail, and the crew would need clothes and tents and cordage, all demanding more wool and grease and hemp and flax and sealskins. That would mean thirty people working for a year to fit out just one ship and its crew. The 11th-century fleets of Denmark and Norway would have required about two million sheep. As for a major warship like the one displayed at the British Museum’s Vikings exhibition in 2014, that would represent something like a year’s work for a team of eight skilled men, not counting the time taken to produce the wood and iron needed.</p><p>Price doesn’t quite describe this as a pirate economy, but he draws the parallel. In the central section of his book he offers something like a narrative history of the Viking Age, but focusing on general trends rather than single dates and events. As he sees it, the first development was ‘maritoria’, markets organised by many petty kings, especially those in geographically fragmented western Norway. These were trade centres, but were dependent on the ‘maritime military power’ exercised by leaders who bore nicknames such as ‘Cruiser’, ‘Screamer’, ‘Sails Alone’ and ‘Sails at Dusk’ (forget about ‘peaceful traders’). Even Harald Fairhair, who became a proper historical king, may have had his nickname cleaned up by later saga writers: he started off as Harald Lúfa, ‘Mophead’.</p><p>This pirate world generated what Price calls (again a term borrowed from the 17th and 18th centuries) a ‘hydrarchy’: there were no overall leaders, no pirate monarchs, and indeed no formal organisation. This made them difficult to deal with, because, as everyone soon found out, making a deal with or buying off one group of Vikings meant nothing to another. A Viking army, at least until the late stages when the kings of Denmark and Sweden (but probably not Norway) had some loose control over their subjects, was a confederation of brotherhoods bound, if at all, by temporary oaths. Gangs left and more gangs joined, depending on the opportunities available.</p><p>The ‘real catalyst’ for the big surge in Viking activity in the ninth century, Price argues, was the civil war in the Frankish Empire between the grandsons of Charlemagne. Anglo-Saxon England was already divided, and Ireland and Scotland even more so. The Vikings came in like the tide, flowing into anywhere they found a gap. In the east, the great rivers of Ukraine and Russia were like the Hudson and the St Lawrence to explorers centuries later, only these had the markets of Byzantium and Baghdad at the end.</p><p>Such​ parallels remind us that the Vikings, for all their strange customs and unknowable psychology, were more like us than we might like to admit. But there was something macabre about them. Adam of Bremen describes the strange rituals at Uppsala, where men and animals were hanged in large numbers in a sacred grove as sacrifices to the gods. Something like this has been discovered at Frösö, or ‘Frey’s Island’, in Sweden: the stump of a birch tree buried under the church altar, surrounded by human and animal bones and body parts, including those of pigs and sheep, as well as six elks and five bears. Did they even hang bears from sacred trees?</p><p>Viking funerals may have been scary affairs as well, and not just for the victims. The craftsmanship of the objects found in the Oseberg boat-burial has been much admired, but the ceremony seems to have been completed in terrible haste, as if the burial party panicked. The chamber was sealed with any old pieces of wood that were handy, hammered in so fast that the wood was dented and the nails bent or broken.</p><p>Patrick Wormald once commented that Vikings rarely seemed to have suffered from madness, though there were psychopaths like Thorgeir Hávarsson, who is said in ‘The Saga of the Fosterbrothers’ to have axed down one innocent bystander just because he looked so temptingly open to the blow. They had a code of honour. In 1012 Thorkel the Tall, a famous captain, is said by Thietmar of Merseburg to have offered everything he had, except his ship, for the life of the captured Archbishop Ælfheah of Canterbury, who had refused to pay a ransom; when Ælfheah was killed anyway, pelted with bones and finished off with an axe, Thorkel changed sides and took his men off to serve Æthelred the Unready. Perhaps he thought killing a defenceless old man was ódrengiligt, not warrior-like behaviour.</p><p>A recent scholar, considering the appalling scene of gang rape and slave murder at the Rus funeral described by Ibn Fadlan, claimed that this ought to put paid to the idea that the Vikings were heroic: they were just cruel. This is naive. Heroism and cruelty are mutually exclusive only in the world of comic books. As Price’s book makes clear, they have often gone together.</p><p>\\n                The Editor \\n                London Review of Books, \\n                28 Little Russell Street \\n                London, WC1A 2HNletters@lrb.co.uk\\n                Please include name, address, and a telephone number.\\n            </p><p>  ‘There is little disagreement’ over the timeline of the Viking Age, Tom Shippey writes (LRB, 13 August). It stretches from the raid on Lindisfarne in 793  to the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066. In England, maybe. But where I live the Viking Age lasted until 1266, when Norway conceded control of the Hebrides to Scotland following an impressive but  less than successful expedition in 1263 by King Haakon. Viewed from Orkney and Shetland the Viking Age ended even later, after King Christian I, then in financial trouble, pledged them as dowry  when his 13-year-old daughter Margaret was betrothed to James III of Scotland in 1468; they were finally ceded to the Scottish Crown in 1472.</p><p>\\n            The Editor\\n            London Review of Books\\n            28 Little Russell Street\\n            London, WC1A 2HN\\n            letters@lrb.co.uk\\n            Please include name, address and a telephone number\\n        </p><p>\\n                            Read anywhere with the London Review of Books app, available now from the App Store for Apple devices, Google Play for Android devices and Amazon for your Kindle Fire.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFor highlights from the latest issue, our archive and the blog, as well as news, events and exclusive promotions.\\n                        </p>\",\"date\":\"2020-8-12\",\"link\":\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n16/tom-shippey/did-they-even-hang-bears\",\"discrp\":\"The mystery of the Vikings.
