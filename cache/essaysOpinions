Alert to the transcendent in the everyday, he perceived a “moral quality” in the very light that fell on the Dutch Colonial homes and lush lawns of the commuter suburbs outside New York. His characters might drink too much, they might break their vows, but they are usually drawn back toward order and light. “Stand up straight,” he urged his readers. “Admire the world. Relish the love of a gentle woman. Trust in the Lord.”</p><p>It was something of a shock, then, when Cheever’s journals were published in 1991. The man who had hymned the love of man and wife was shown to be tormented by homosexual longing. (“Every comely man, every bank clerk and delivery boy was aimed at my life like a loaded pistol.”) The drunken escapades of his characters took on a darker cast when seen alongside his own grim battle with drink.</p><p>Even those who knew Cheever and had some sense of his contradictions were surprised by the journals. “They tell me more about Cheever’s lusts and failures and self-humiliations and crushing sense of shame and despond,” John Updike wrote, “than I can easily reconcile with my memories of the sprightly, debonair, gracious man, often seen on the arm of his pretty, witty wife.”</p><p>But perhaps the greatest surprise was Cheever’s deep religious feeling. Time and again, we find him seeking consolation at his village’s Episcopal church, moved by the sight of the Eucharist, consoled by the words of the Creed. “If my hands tremble with desire,” he wrote, “they tremble likewise when I reach for the chalice on Sunday, and if lust makes me run and caper it is no stronger a force than that which brings me to my knees to say thanksgivings and litanies.”</p><p>What was the nature of Cheever’s belief? He was not a dogmatic man. He took no interest in theology. But his keen spiritual sense had a definite tendency. Like so many of his countrymen, he sought to throw off his ancestors’ Puritan austerities. Rather than deny the flesh and despise worldly comforts, he sought to embrace all of life. His was an unascetic spirituality. Yet he could not escape ambivalence about the world he embraced.</p><p>John Cheever’s religious pedigree can be traced to Ezekiel Cheever, the first Cheever in America and headmaster of the Boston Latin School from 1671 to 1708. Samuel Sewall, a judge at the Salem witch ­trials, noted with approval that Ezekiel “abominated periwigs” (a fashionable item, which the schoolmaster would sometimes pull from his students’ heads). When Cotton Mather delivered Ezekiel’s eulogy, he praised the great man’s “­untiring abjuration of the devil.”</p><p>Long after Puritanism had ceased to be a vital force, this severe inheritance was sustained in debased form. Christian Science, a bizarre nineteenth-century heresy that arose in the hard, stony ground of Congregationalist piety, disdains the material world as an illusion. Cheever’s mother adopted this faith, and her son recalled how she confessed “to having been so enchained by the flesh that a cancer was destroying her.”</p><p>Christian Science, with its optimistic, scientistic promise that men can be healed through right thinking, is a far cry from the high and grand faith of Plymouth Bay. But Cheever’s experience of it made him suspicious of the broader tradition of Christian asceticism. Cheever at times reproached himself for a lack of self-denial. “When have I known the taste of abstinence and self-discipline?” he wrote. But he tended toward viewing every form of carnal love—homosexual and heterosexual, adulterous and conjugal—as a good. “What can this capricious skin be,” he asked, “but a blessing?”</p><p>When Cheever developed tuberculosis at age twelve, his mother refused to get medical help. He later reproached her for leaving him alone in a dirty house, where he was spitting blood and flailing in sweat-soaked sheets, as she went to church to introduce an Armenian refugee.</p><p>Given this upbringing, it is unsurprising that Cheever’s god at times seemed to be the spirit of hearth and home. Cheever was capable of skewering suburban comfort—the homes that looked (as he put it in one story) like “the temples in a sacred grove, dedicated to monogamy, feckless childhood, and domestic bliss”—but he was irresistibly drawn to the vision of order presented by the freshly mowed lawn and well-laid table.</p><p>“The simplest arrangements,” he wrote in his journals, “trees, a line of bathhouses, a church steeple, a bench in a park . . . appear to have a moral significance, a ­continuity that is heartening and that corresponds to my whole sense of being.” For Cheever, these quotidian forms of order were signs that the world was finally ­ordered toward something divine. They gave him “a sense of fitness that approaches ecstasy—the sense of life as a privilege, the earth as something splendid to walk on.”</p><p>“Goodbye, My Brother,” the first of Cheever’s collected stories, offers a full picture of Cheever’s religious sensibility. The narrator represents Cheever’s more expansive, humane side, while the narrator’s brother, Lawrence, represents the more severe instincts that Cheever never quite managed to shake. He finds fault in every foible and ­superfluity—the excessive drinking, foolish spending, and wandering eyes of his family. He is a caricature of the Puritans, animated by “perpetual guilt and the deification of the scourge.”</p><p>Lawrence’s dark view of the world captures a great deal of truth, but it is vanquished by a rapturous vision of the glories of man and nature. “Oh, what can you do with a man like that?” Cheever’s narrator asks. “How can you teach him to respond to the inestimable greatness of the race, the harsh surface beauty of life . . . ?” Just as the complaints of Job are overcome by a show of the majesty of God, Lawrence’s carping is overwhelmed by the grandeur of nature and humanity.</p><p>Such ecstatic moments may work well for concluding short stories, but they are not sufficient to sustain a happy life. The kind of order for which Cheever pined requires definite limits as well as vaulting realizations. On the morning after the birth of his youngest son, Cheever was standing on a balcony, watching a car full of rambunctious young men go by. He longed to join in their chaos and hell-raising. “But I have been [gallivanting] with the bucks,” he wrote, and “my longing for the permanence I have left is much more painful.”</p><p>In his journals, Cheever expressed his conflicting impulses in terms of a choice between two women. One, with yellow hair, stands for “a boundless chain of lighted rooms; the easy talk and laughter of friends and lovers; healthy pride, and a winning score.” The other, with dark hair, evokes a small, confined space. She is friendless, “and yet it is the declivity of her back that his fingers seem to want to trace.”</p><p>Cheever’s journals document his struggle to reconcile his simultaneous needs for chaos and order, a young man’s body and the love of a gentle woman. He chronicles his struggles in exacting detail, a self-examination equal to anything found in the spiritual diaries of Puritans. “I have not repaired the shutter on the west window. I have not got sand for the driveway or mixed fuel for the chain saw,” he wrote. “I have been drunken, dirty, unkind, embittered, and lewd.”</p><p>Cheever described the beauty of monogamy and conjugal love while failing to accept its constraints. He adored the language of the Book of Common Prayer—“the penultimate clauses spread out behind their predicates in breadth and glory”—but was not bound by its moral claims. He was right to resist the moralizing of some of his more politically engaged contemporaries. But his own stance verged toward complacency: “Without an indictment I seem to have no moral position—no position, in fact, at all.”</p><p>No position—but oh, what prose. Cheever was at his best in recording the splendor of the receding sun, the magic hours stretching from late afternoon to twilight: “The sun going down takes many forms,” he wrote, “gold, brass cauldrons, streaks of lemon yellow and then, unexpectedly, a field of rose.” It was fitting, then, that Cheever lived in the twilight hours of America’s Protestant settlement, in a land still warm from—but no longer illuminated directly by—departed certainties. As the memory of a Protestant consensus expired, Cheever gave us a doubting, wayward version of its spiritual poetry.</p>\",\"date\":\"2020-8-28\",\"link\":\"https://www.firstthings.com/article/2020/08/cheevers-god\",\"discrp\":\"John Cheever took no interest in theology.

His videos have poor production values: the camera looms too close to his face, and the lighting is often too bright or too dark. He records himself at his home office in Petersburg, Virginia (he abandoned his native Brazil during Lula da Silva’s first term), with crammed bookshelves visible behind him. If he’s not smoking as he talks, he’s ready to, with cigarettes and a lighter placed before him on his desk.</p><p>Carvalho speaks without notes on a wide variety of subjects, some with intellectual pretensions, others on the fringe of politics, if not reality. He has held forth on theories of perception in modern philosophy, and also claimed that PepsiCo uses the cells of aborted fetuses to manufacture its sodas and that the Inquisition has been unjustifiably traduced.</p><p>Remarkably, the seventy-three-year-old autodidact who, though the son of a provincial lawyer, did not complete his secondary education, exerts enormous influence in his native Brazil. A champion of the extreme right, his ideas appeal to Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro’s admiration for Olavo (as he is known, in Brazilian fashion, even to his enemies) was so great when he was elected that when the president visited Washington, D.C., not long after his election in 2019, Carvalho was seated next to him at an official dinner. On that occasion, Bolsonaro, whose policies and worldview are both echoed and reaffirmed by Carvalho, proclaimed, “The revolution we are living, we owe in large part to him.” In 2020, as the coronavirus continued its rapid, worldwide spread, Bolsonaro insisted that the virus presented no real danger. It was, he charged, “fake news” and just “a little flu.” Carvalho was quick to parrot his admirer. “This epidemic,” he said in late March of this year, “simply does not exist.”</p><p>Unlike Steve Bannon, to whom he is often compared, Carvalho has expressed no interest in serving in his country’s government. He aims for something bigger and longer lasting. As João Moreira Salles, the filmmaker and publisher of the magazine piauí, told me, “Carvalho wants to be the Brazilian Gramsci.” His ambition is to establish a right-wing, nationalist, hegemonic doctrine by force of will, and by means of videoconferences, articles, tweets, and Facebook posts. He has been facilitated in his mission, allowed to name ministers in Bolsonaro’s government—among them Ernesto Araújo, who Carvalho described as “the Brazilian most qualified to be minister of foreign relations.” Araújo has written that only “Donald Trump can save the West,” and that climate change is a “Marxist conspiracy.”</p><p>The reasons Carvalho has become so visible are likely related to the reasons that gave rise to Bolsonaro. Brazil’s horrific murder and crime rates might have played a part in shaking Brazilians’ faith in the existing system, while the money-laundering scandal known as Operação Lava Jato (Operation Car Wash) laid bare the corruption at nearly every level of Brazilian society and politics, working in Bolsonaro’s favor. The scandal’s complicated nature and cascading ramifications make conspiracy theories like Carvalho’s sound almost plausible.</p><p>Much of what can be found in Carvalho’s productions is fairly straightforward right-wing conspiracy fare, though couched in his pseudo-philosophical language. He opposes vaccination and believes Barack Obama was not born in the United States. More novel are his doubts that the earth revolves around the sun, and his skepticism about whether it truly is round, not flat. Most Brazilians are devout Catholics, but Carvalho nevertheless alleges that Christianity is in such a precarious state that “[i]n Brazil . . . pedophilia is more respected and protected” than the Church.</p><p>Despite Carvalho’s fervent support of Benjamin Netanyahu (a strongman after his own heart), he has trafficked over the years in many of the classic anti-Semitic notions of the far right, as well as more novel fabrications. Adding to the conspiracy theory about the Bilderberg Group and the Trilateral Commission, Carvalho updates the canard of the Elders of Zion, claiming there is a Consórcio—a consortium—that rules the world. This consortium, he writes, is a dynastic “organization of large-scale capitalists and international bankers committed to establishing a worldwide socialist dictatorship.” He describes George Soros as “a Jew who helped the Nazis seize the property of other Jews,” who is guilty of “financing every anti-American and anti-Israeli movement in the world.”</p><p>Elsewhere, Carvalho attacks the alleged nexus of big money, the left, and the Jews with more subtlety. The Frankfurt School, he claims, “was not only founded by a capitalist billionaire Felix Weyl” [sic] but was “always led by people from stylish families, like Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Leo Löwenthal, and their kind.” This description of the birth of the Frankfurt School did not keep Carvalho from alleging, in an interview with a right-wing American website, that it was founded by the Communist International as a means of weakening Western society.</p><p>This conflation of billionaires, Jews, and left-wing thinkers is hardly a secondary feature of Carvalho’s worldview. He holds the “cultural Marxism” it represents chiefly responsible for the moral rot of Brazilian and Western society. In this respect Carvalho is not an innovator. The far right has inveighed against “cultural Marxism” for decades, leveling complaints that are now resonating in the lower depths of the global movement Carvalho represents in Brazil. Anders Breivik, the Norwegian mass murderer, included “cultural Marxists” among his enemies in his 1,500-page manifesto, discovered after his killing spree in 2011.</p><p>But, for Carvalho, no group was more influential, or evil, than the Frankfurt School. Although he describes the writings of Adorno and Benjamin as “indecipherable,” he still asserts that since the 1960s the Frankfurt School has exerted a greater influence “over the national left than classical Marxism-Leninism” thanks to its propagation in universities. According to Carvalho, members of the Frankfurt School sought to prove that “all the values, symbols, beliefs, and millenarian cultural property” were “a fraud and a dirty trick.” Under their influence, romantic scenes in films were “replaced by explicit sex.” Music was no longer melodic and harmonic. Even women’s makeup now “had to suggest that they were dead or at least had AIDS.”</p><p>The political scientist Miguel Lago told me that Carvalho has even alleged that the correlation of cigarettes and lung cancer is an invention of “cultural Marxists.” The campaign to spread awareness of this seemingly unimpeachable fact represents, for Carvalho, the left testing its power to impose its will: if the left could convince the world of the relationship between cigarettes and cancer, then everything else was possible. For Carvalho, then, smoking in public is an act of political defiance.</p><p>“Cultural Marxism” describes a perceived cultural hegemony, not a political force. The real enemy, for Carvalho, is communism. A member of the Brazilian Communist Party from 1966 to 1968, he claims to have left after he “witnessed acts [he] considered sadistic.” Carvalho’s hatred of communist ideology is beyond measure, rivaled only by his joy in attacking it. Writing recently of his experience as a young communist and his subsequent, lifelong career as an anticommunist warrior, he wrote: “For someone who has helped to build a lie in youth, you cannot fathom the pleasure derived from destroying it in maturity, brick by brick, with the sadistic meticulousness of the wrecker.”</p><p>Communism in Brazil has a long and tortured history, but it has no more influence in the country today than it does elsewhere in the world. Yet Carvalho writes about the communist menace as if the downfall of the Soviet Union and its allies had never occurred. In a radio interview in 2000 he claimed that “we are on the brink of a communist seizure of power in a revolutionary process.” Earlier this year, with Bolsonaro in power and the opposition momentarily cowed, Carvalho continued to issue warnings that “the greatest frustration of a communist is not to have risen sufficiently in life to be able to have all rightists killed.”</p><p>At its core, Carvalho’s entire project is an effort to apply the Gramscian notion of hegemony to Brazilian society in order to cleanse it of “cultural Marxism” and all its diabolic influence. Carvalho “is obsessed by Gramsci,” observes Salles. “He wants to create a reactionary hegemony in the cultural realm, which explains his success in putting his people in strategic positions related to education and the arts.”</p><p>Gramsci and the idea of hegemony recur constantly in Carvalho’s writings, but in doing so he turns the concept on its head, insisting it has been achieved not by the ruling class, but by the opposition to that class. He also attributes to Gramsci and the communists—assisted by “cultural Marxists”—a long-term plot to take over the government, one that was in place even while the military was in power between 1964 and 1985.</p><p>With Bolsonaro in power, Carvalho has been able to weaponize his reactionary vision. As Salles told me, “One can argue that there’s presently no ‘intellectual’ in the world who yields so much power and influence over a national government.” Abraham Weintraub, Brazil’s minister of education, is a Carvalho disciple, evidenced by his claim that crack was introduced into Brazil by the communists to weaken the country. So is Roberto Alvim, the special secretary for culture who was recently fired after recycling (without attribution) phrases from a speech originally made by Joseph Goebbels, using the propagandist’s words to describe the future of Brazilian culture, with excerpts from Wagner’s Lohengrin playing in the background.</p><p>Despite his influence on Bolsonaro, Carvalho has expressed disappointment that the president has not taken a firmer stand against his adversaries. In March he tweeted that though the president was elected “to bring down the system, Bolsonaro, advised by timid generals and politicians, preferred to adapt himself to them. Suicide.” Carvalho boasted that though he had “advised [the president] to disarm his enemies BEFORE attempting to resolve any ‘national problem’ . . . [h]e has done the opposite.” These statements are an echo of Carvalho’s belief that the military demonstrated undue softness during its murderous rule. His use of the word enemies is, of course, not accidental. Though Brazil is a democracy, where opponents or the opposition would be the acceptable words to describe political rivals, for Carvalho, left-wing politicians are enemies who must be destroyed.</p><p>It is hardly surprising that Carvalho despises democracy. Given his patchwork of fringe political ideas, it is fitting that he is a disciple of the French thinker René Guénon, who died in 1951. Guénon’s antidemocratic notions and calls for an immutable, strictly hierarchical social order reflect Carvalho’s ideal society. Guénon wrote that “the decisive argument against democracy can be summed up in a few words: the superior cannot proceed from the inferior.” In keeping with this medieval view of society, Carvalho believes that intellectuals of his kind have a special role: he identifies a “priestly or sacerdotal caste,” an “intelligentsia” whose job it is to guide the state in driving “the process of modernization, and thus, to determine the meaning of collective life, its values and moral criteria, to define what is right and what is wrong, what is true and what is false.”</p><p>Carvalho continues to press Bolsonaro from the right, urging him to be even more extreme. “What,” he asked in March, “has Bolsonaro done against ANY of his enemies? NOTHING. NOTHING EVER. He’s only dealt them pinpricks, irritating them instead of weakening them.” If his statements, tweets, Facebook posts, writings, and lectures are indeed the works of a philosopher, they are those of a philosopher as described by the thinker he considers the source of much of the world’s evil. Karl Marx, in his eleventh thesis on Feuerbach, wrote, “The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it.”</p>\",\"date\":\"2020-8-27\",\"link\":\"https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/the-gramsci-of-the-brazilian-right\",\"discrp\":\"Olavo de Carvalho, a 73-year-old right-wing autodidact, is on a mission: He wants to become the Brazilian Gramsci.\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}","failed","{\"content\":\"<p>At the start of 1873, Leo Tolstoy was fresh from the success\\nof War and Peace and aware that the world was expecting an equally\\nmonumental work of art, something that would match that book (he refused to\\ncall it a novel) in historical scope and philosophic profundity. As such, he\\nwas consumed with writing a primer to teach Russian children the alphabet. He\\nwas sure it would be his legacy. “My proud hopes are\\nthese,” he wrote to a friend, “that two generations of all Russian children,\\nfrom those of the tsar to those of the peasants, will learn using only this\\nprimer, and they will get their first poetic impressions from it, and that,\\nhaving written this primer, it will be possible for me to die peacefully.”</p><p>Perhaps it was this obsession with letters, the\\nbeauty of their shape and the world of possibilities encoded in each one, that\\ncan explain the curious second proposal scene between Kitty and Levin in Anna\\nKarenina (she rejected his first) in which the two communicate using just\\nthe first letter of each word they want to say. “He wrote the initial letters, w, y, a, m, t, c, b, d, t, m, n, o, t,”\\nand Kitty understands intuitively that Levin is asking her. “When you answered\\nme, ‘that cannot be,’ did you mean never or then?” Only t, only “then”\\nit turns out, to Levin’s great happiness. In Creating Anna\\nKarenina, Robert Blaisdell does not make this connection between Tolstoy’s\\nwork on the alphabet book and this scene from the novel, but it is the type of\\nparallelism between the great Russian author’s life and art that interests him.  </p><p>A professor of English at the City University of\\nNew York (Kingsborough), Blaisdell learned Russian in order to read the Anna\\nKarenina novel in the original (after having first reread the novel in the English translation upwards of 20 times). The work of a Tolstoy superfan rather\\nthan a Tolstoy scholar per se, Creating Anna Karenina is an\\ninformal and chatty effort to understand what Tolstoy was up to in the four\\nyears he spent composing the novel. As it turns out, Blaisdell tells us, he was\\ndrinking\\ncopious amounts of “koumiss” (fermented mare’s milk) to stave off tuberculosis, penning vociferous calls for agrarian reform, learning Ancient Greek with the\\nhelp of a priest, and trying to find a governess to tend to his growing family.\\nThe latter situation had gotten particularly desperate; Tolstoy wrote to a\\nfriend begging for references. “Nationality is of no matter: German, French,\\nEnglish, Russian—as long as it’s European and\\nChristian. Salary—everything I can give.” Blaisdell wonders if Tolstoy had this\\nstress in mind when he decided to open Anna Karenina with the story of a\\nhouse torn to pieces by a governess’s dismissal\\n(though of course in the novel it happens under more adulterous circumstances). </p><p>It is a big stretch, and Blaisdell knows as much, but his\\nbook is more of a playful experiment than a strict study. In its study of the\\ncomings and goings of the Tolstoy household at the time of the novel’s\\ncomposition, Creating Anna Karenina asks if one of the world’s greatest\\nnovels was in fact just as much a product of everyday minutia—like who stops by\\nfor a visit with what kind of gossip to tell—as it was the culmination of\\nlong-simmering ideas about morality and desire. The result is a work in many\\nways more instructive about the creative process than about Anna Karenina\\nspecifically, a consideration of how distractions, familial interference, and\\nside projects resulted in Tolstoy writing one of the world’s greatest novels.</p><p>The inspiration behind the character of Anna Karenina\\nis widely considered to be a 37-year-old woman named Anna Stepanova, who worked\\nas a housekeeper for one of Tolstoy’s neighbors. She and her husband regularly\\nargued about his flirtations with governesses. Finally, she became so consumed\\nwith jealousy that she threw herself under a train but\\nnot before sending off a letter addressed to her husband, which reportedly read, “You are my killer; you will be happy with her if murderers can be happy. If\\nyou want to see me, you can view my body on the rails of Yasenki.” As the\\nfamily knew the woman well, Tolstoy personally went to observe the autopsy; his\\nwife wrote to a friend that he “was terribly shaken. He had known Anna\\nStepanovna as a tall, stout woman, Russian in face and character, a brunette\\nwith grey eyes, not beautiful but attractive.” The episode happened in 1872,\\njust a year before Tolstoy first sketched out the character of Anna Karenina,\\nwho likewise had gray eyes. </p><p>In March of 1873, Tolstoy told his wife, Sophia,\\nthat he had written a page-and-a-half and was “pleased with it.” She assumed he\\nwas referring to the major book he had been planning to write about Peter the\\nGreat, a fitting historical epic to follow War and Peace. Before this\\nrevelation, Tolstoy had been struggling greatly to write. “My\\nwork is not moving” he wrote his friend, the poet Afanasy Fet. To another, he\\ncomplained, “Everything has been arranged so as to distract me: acquaintances,\\nhunting, a court session in October with me as a juryman, and then the\\npainter,” the latter referring to the portrait artist who had been sent to\\nTolstoy’s estate to paint him on behalf of the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow.</p><p>The artist, Blaisdell writes, did however prove useful in\\noffering some gossip from the capital. Anna Suvorina, the wife of a prominent\\npublicist, was shot to death in a hotel in Saint Petersburg by a young man who\\nhad been in love with her. After killing Suvorina, the young man took his own\\nlife. The press was transfixed by the story as it combined society gossip with a\\ncrime of passion, and it all unfolded in one of the capital’s glitziest hotels.\\nTolstoy, too, was fascinated when he heard about it from the portraitist and\\nasked a friend to send him “any details of the murder.” Blaisdell sees the\\nepisode as an example of Tolstoy’s growing fascination with suicide: Tolstoy’s\\neditor, Mikhail Katkov, soon afterward lost a brother to suicide, and in his\\nconversion memoir, A Confession (1881), Tolstoy admitted that he too had\\ncontemplated ending his own life around this time. Linking these stories with Anna’s\\nsuicide (and her lover Vronsky’s attempt to do so), Blaisdell identifies a\\nlarger epidemic of suicides that was sweeping the country, a symptom of a\\ndeeper, collective depression rather than just the result of a single love\\naffair gone awry. Indeed, the failures of Tsar Alexander II’s reforms to lead\\nto meaningful change had blanketed Russian society of the 1870s with a sense of\\ndisorientation and dread. In the next decade, Alexander II would die at the\\nhands of a suicide bomber.</p><p>Blaisdell threads these biographical resonances throughout Creating\\nAnna Karenina, presenting a view of Tolstoy’s life that makes the writing\\nof Anna Karenina feel almost inevitable. As well as the crimes of\\npassion that seem to abound in Tolstoy’s social circle, there is also the\\nsummer he spends on the Russian steppe witnessing firsthand the poor implementation\\nof the government’s agrarian reforms. Such experiences, scholars agree, no\\ndoubt played a role in his fashioning of the character of Konstantin Levin, who\\nfunctions in the novel as a kind of mirror of Tolstoy, a wealthy landowner who\\ntries to settle his crisis of faith by laboring alongside peasants in the\\nfields. </p><p>Despite these sources for inspiration seemingly all around\\nhim, Tolstoy still struggled to write throughout 1872. His breakthrough the\\nfollowing March came when by chance he started leafing through the collected\\nworks of Alexander Pushkin. Suddenly, for reasons unclear, Tolstoy was jolted\\ninto action and sketched the entire plot of Anna Karenina in short\\norder. As he wrote to a friend at the time, “I thought up characters and\\nevents, began to go on with it, then of course changed it, and suddenly all the\\nthreads became so well and truly tied up that the result was a novel which I\\nfinished in draft form today, a very lively, impassioned and well-finished\\nnovel which I’m very pleased with and which will be ready in 2 weeks-time if\\nGod gives me strength.”</p><p>Two weeks turned into four years, as it happens. After\\nsubmitting the first installment, which was published in The Russian Herald (the same journal that earlier published War\\nand Peace and Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment), Tolstoy found\\nhimself distracted and disinterested. “My God,” he wrote to his friend, the\\nliterary critic Nikolai Strakhov, “if only someone would finish A. Karenina for\\nme! It’s unbearably repulsive.” Tolstoy’s wife Sonia, who did his copying, had\\nbeen ill from consecutive pregnancies and sick with grief after losing a\\ndaughter just hours after giving birth. Tolstoy also absorbed himself into his\\nschool for peasant children, further developing his alphabet primer, and\\noften wondered if Anna Karenina was a useless indulgence in comparison\\nwith his work on education. The latter half of Blaisdell’s book is rife with\\nletters to friends that show how plagued with self-doubt Tolstoy was at this\\ntime. “I’m disgusted with what I’ve written,” he\\ntells Strakhov. “I need to cross it all out\\nand throw it away and disown it and say ‘I’m sorry, I won’t do it again.’” </p><p>Such letters are perhaps the highlight\\nof Creating Anna Karenina because they bring us closer to Tolstoy’s\\ninner world and creative process in a book that otherwise feels overly terrestrial.\\nFor Blaisdell, the story of how Anna\\nKarenina was made is firmly tied to what Tolstoy’s life looked like on a\\nday-to-day basis—whose governess was seen with whom. This method has its\\nlimitations. Blaisdell tells us about the changes that occurred between drafts\\nbut offers little insight into why Tolstoy, who initially sketched Anna as\\ncontemptible, silly, and unattractive, transformed her into one of literature’s\\nmost charismatic and complex heroines.</p><p>To do so would require a much deeper\\nengagement with the French novel of adultery, to which Anna Karenina was a direct response. Blaisdell only briefly alludes\\nto the Alexander Dumas fils essay “Man-Woman” (1872), which claimed that men had\\nthe right to kill unfaithful wives (the essay ends with the words “Tue-la,” or “kill her”). Despite her grim fate, Tolstoy’s adulteress was treated with\\nrelative sympathy and complexity compared to her French antecedents. In\\nultimately refusing to make Anna a caricature of cruelty or Karenin a totally\\npure and pitiful soul, Tolstoy undid the conventions of the genre, preferring to\\nexplore the potential for anyone to be overtaken by desire.</p><p>To read Anna Karenina this way requires not seeing\\nTolstoy as simply a sui generis artist who stumbled around his estate\\ncollecting anecdotes. Like all writers, Tolstoy read voraciously and borrowed\\nextensively; his art was a response to other art as much as it was to daily\\nlife.

These lifeless bits of sea dander are actually the decomposing particles of animals who died hundreds of feet above the midnight zone. The vampire squid reaches for this snow with two long ribbons of skin, which are separate from its eight tentacles. If it is truly hungry, it trains its large eye on a glow, the lure of something larger—a gulper eel, perhaps, or an anglerfish waddling through the inky water. The squid’s eye is about the size of a shooter marble, but this is nevertheless the largest eye-to-body ratio of any animal on the planet.</p><p>If the squid feels threatened or wants to disappear, perhaps no other creature in the ocean knows how to convey that with a more dazzling yet effective show. When the vampire squid pulse-swims away, each of its arm tips glow and wave in different directions, confusing for any predator. To make an even more speedy getaway, the squid uses jet propulsion by flapping its fins down toward its mantle and simultaneously blasting a stream of water from its siphon—all of its arms in one direction. In the next stroke, the squid raises all of its arms over its head in what is called a “pineapple posture.” The underside of these arms is lined with tiny toothlike structures called “cirri,” giving an appearance of fangs ready to bite down on anything that wants to chase it down for a snack.</p><p>As if that wasn’t enough to shoo away a predator, the vampire squid discharges a luminescent cloud of mucus instead of ink. The congealed swirl and curlicue of light temporarily baffles the predator, who ends up not knowing where or what to chomp—while the vampire squid whooshes away, meters ahead. It’s as if you were chasing someone and they stopped, turned, and tossed a bucketful of large, gooey green sequins at your face. </p><p>I wished I was a vampire squid the most when I was the new girl in high school. We had moved around for so much of my childhood, but the most difficult move I ever made was between my sophomore and junior years. I moved from a class of about a hundred students in western New York to well over five hundred in Beavercreek, a suburb of Dayton, Ohio. I went from sophomore class president to a little no one, a gal who tried out for the tennis team not because I had any interest in the sport but because at practice, at least, I didn’t have to be alone. I ate lunch in the library. I ate lunch in a stairwell hardly anyone used. I ate lunch in the dark enclave of the only elevator, hidden outside anyone’s eyesight, except for the occasional student on crutches or in a wheelchair. Once I ate lunch—my sad peanut butter and jelly sandwich—while standing up in a scratched and markered-up bathroom stall. To pass the hour, I read the often vulgar, sometimes funny graffiti scrawled on the stall door, just so no one could see that I had no one to talk to.</p><p>This was my cephalopod year, the closest I ever came to wanting to disappear or sneak away into the deep sea. I had never feared the first day of classes or meeting new people before. After tennis practice, when everyone else was making plans to meet up at the local pizza parlor, I made myself vanish. I don’t know if my teammates even noticed, or wondered where I went.</p><p>Oh, I didn’t finish high school like that, swimming in darkness. I did end up making friends, giggling with them in the back of the school bus. I joined a bunch of delightfully nerdy pals on the speech and debate team, and I eventually made the varsity tennis team, playing doubles at the district level with my sister. There was no hiding anymore. People noticed when I had to leave parties early for my curfew. They didn’t want me to go. And I had a teacher—Ms. Harding—who wanted me to shine. I know it sounds incredibly precious, but these friends made me believe the mantra “If one of us does well, we all do well.” They were generous with their support. Playing it cool was boring. They were my kinfolk, my people—many of whom I’m still friends with today, though we’ve scattered across the country, spilling out in different directions as fast as we could once we’d tossed our graduation caps in the air.</p><p>But there wasn’t one specific turning point where I stopped trying to disappear. I don’t know how I wiggled out of that solitude, how I made it through the darkest and loneliest year of my youth. No more of those half-eaten lunches hurriedly tossed into the trash. No more make-believe “research” I pretended to do so the librarian would just let me read in peace. Instead, I began scribbling in notebooks and notebooks, trying to write my way into being since I never saw anyone who looked like me in books, movies, or videos. None of this writing was what I would remotely call poetry, but I know it had a lyric register. I was teaching myself (and badly copying) metaphor. I was figuring out the delight and pop of music, and the electricity on my tongue when I read out loud. I was at the surface again. I was once more the girl who had begged my parents and principal to let me start school a whole year early. And I was hungry.</p><p>I emerged from my cephalopod year, exited my midnight zone. But I’m grateful for my time there. If not for that shadow year, how would I know how to search the faces of my own students? Or to drop everything and check in, really check, with each of my sons when they come home from school, to make sure they are having a good time and feel safe? If not for that year where no one talked to me on the school bus, where I had no valentines, no dates, I wouldn’t know what to say to my student with the greasy backpack, who sits in the corner by herself and doesn’t make eye contact. Who never talks in her other classes and never spoke in my class unless called upon. I wouldn’t know how to tell if her solitude is voluntary or if it covers up a hunger to be seen, to glow with friendship like I had every other year. I secretly love the audacity of her tousled hair, stacked into a giant sloppy bun on top of her head—this student who constantly shuffles in late and is the last to leave but always, always reads ahead on the syllabus. The one who tells me after I come back from being out sick with the flu for a whole week: I missed you, I am so, so glad you were here today.</p><p>Me too, I say. And I mean it. I wouldn’t know how wide and how radiant a student like that could make me smile.</p><p>Aimee Nezhukumatathil is the author of four collections of poems, including, most recently, Oceanic, winner of the Mississippi Institute of Arts and Letters Award.

Available to download as e-books, with physical boxsets being supplied to libraries, the project, according to Bailey’s and the prize, is “finally giving female writers the credit they deserve”. </p><p>Well intentioned and laudable though this aim is, one may also\\nargue that it misses the point of the pseudonymous writer, and the difference between\\nthe public and the private self, let alone the question of self-identification.\\nThese are subjects that should be treated with more sensitivity in these\\npluralistic times. </p><p>Does George Eliot, whose Middlemarch\\nis featured here, really need “reclaiming” as Mary Ann Evans? The “Reclaim Her Name”\\nbio glibly states that Eliot was “forced to use a male pen name”, as if she\\nwere incapable of making her own decisions. \\n“George Eliot” was Evans’s public persona, with, surely, no need for\\nretrospective correction. By the time\\nMiddlemarch was published, the reading public was fully aware of its author’s\\nreal identity. Besides, by 1871/72, when Middlemarch\\nfirst appeared in instalments, the name she was known by was Marian Evans\\nLewes, as the common-law wife of her partner George Henry Lewes. According to\\nthe Oxford Dictionary of National\\nBiography, “Mary Ann” was not used by Eliot from 1851 until 1880, the last\\nyear of her life, when she chose “Mary Ann Cross” on her marriage to John\\nWalter Cross. Intentions matter, but so does legacy. Is it really for others to\\nspeak for Eliot/Evans and designate a different agency? </p><p>The writer Vernon Lee, meanwhile, whose supernatural fiction\\nand art criticism should certainly be better known, has her gothic horror novel\\nThe Phantom Lover republished under\\nViolet Paget, a name that Lee – a lesbian and a feminist –  chose, in her life as in her writing, and for\\nher own reasons, to cast off. (I had to double-check that Radclyffe Hall, the author\\nof The Well of Loneliness, doesn’t\\nappear in this list,  unwillingly recast\\nwith her birth, or “dead name” of Marguerite.)</p><p>Indiana, published in 1832 under “the male pseudonym used by the\\n19th century French novelist Amantine Aurore Dupin” (according to the BBC\\nwebsite) is also given a make-over. Again, this is misleading. It was Sand who\\nwas the novelist, not Dupin. “George Sand” was as much a part of her image as\\nthe men’s clothes she wore and the tobacco she openly smoked. (Indiana was the first novel Sand\\npublished independently under her chosen pen name.) Sand was the most popular\\nwriter in Europe of any gender by the age of twenty-seven, and enjoyed greater\\npopularity in England during the 1830s and 40s than her fellow French novelists\\nHonoré du Balzac or Victor Hugo, the latter of whom, at his funeral eulogy for her\\nin 1876 commented: “George Sand was an idea. She has a unique place in our age”.\\nAnd yet “Reclaim Her Name” sums her up with the line: “her romances were known\\nworldwide. It’s time her name was too”.</p><p>On the other hand, Liz Petry, the daughter of Ann Petry, perhaps best known as the author of The Street, is delighted that her mother’s novel Marie of the Cabin Club, which originally appeared in 1939 under the pseudonym Arnold Petri, is being bought out under her real name. “I’m incredibly proud of my mother’s work and it excites me that her writing has been introduced to a new audience”, she said. This rectifying seems entirely fitting for Petry, a writer who went on to publish under her own name; but the troubling aspect of the Bailey’s project is that its rather superficial analysis and one-size-fits-all approach overlooks the complexities of publishing history, in which pseudonyms aren’t always about conforming to patriarchal or other obvious standards. The relentless obsession in recent years with the “unmasking” of the writer who goes by the name of Elena Ferrante is a case in point, as is the fact that writers the world over routinely use pseudonyms or anonymity because of fear of prosecution or even death. </p><p>There is a danger here of being ahistorical rather than historically accurate. Virago Press, which launched its first modern classic in 1978, beginning a list of women writers who were then largely forgotten, notably kept the pen name of George Egerton, the author of Keynotes. Keynotes is republished by the “Reclaim Her Name” project under the name Mary Bright, although Egerton was born Mary Chavelita Dunne, and “Golding Bright” was her husband’s surname. “Mary Bright”, therefore, seems to be a name of the project’s own making.  </p><p>In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, male writers\\nused women’s names in order to publish certain types of fiction viewed as,\\nwell, unmanly. Women authors often reverted to anonymity rather than\\npseudonymity – for example by publishing work as “by A Lady”. (The first\\nedition of Frankenstein in 1818 was\\npublished anonymously, with Mary Shelley’s name first appearing in the second\\nedition of 1821.)  It is indisputably the\\ncase that women writers were frequently marginalized, patronized and dismissed\\nas frivolous, and for that reason –  but\\nnot only that reason – chose a male pen name. (The intensely\\nprivate Ellis Bell, better known as Emily Brontë, was horrified when she was\\nrevealed as the author of Wuthering\\nHeights.) The commercial aspects of author’s names should not be\\noverlooked, either. Writers want to sell their books in an uncertain market –\\nas true 150 years ago as it is today. </p><p>My first graduate job, in the early 1990s, was at the British Library, where I would spend hours cataloguing nineteenth-century books as part of an early digitization project. Piles of Victorian three-decker novels, by writers using real names, pseudonyms or none at all were retrieved from the book stacks, their uncut pages a sad testament to the fact that no one but me had touched them in years. This is one of many genuinely unvisited tombs of literature (to paraphrase the final line of Middlemarch) which “Reclaim Her Name” might like to consider for any future projects.  </p><p>Catherine Taylor is a freelance writer and critic who has been publisher at The Folio Society and deputy director of English PEN </p>\",\"date\":\"2020-8-20\",\"link\":\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/the-story-of-a-new-name/\",\"discrp\":\"Does republishing George Eliot as Mary Ann Evans \\\"reclaim\\\" her lost female identity?

Courtesy the Busy Beaver Button Museum, Chicago, and Hake’s Auctions, York, Pennsylvania </p><p>In August 2017, a few weeks before the fall semester began at Cornell University, I received an email inviting me to participate in a campaign called “I’m First!” The idea was to encourage “faculty and staff on campus to identify themselves, via T-shirt or button, as the first in their family to graduate from a four-year institution.” The rationale for this themed costume party was the following: “This visual campaign will allow first-generation students to clearly identify (and connect with) faculty and professional staff that have had similar experiences as them!” Though I have been a tenured professor at Cornell for eleven years, neither of my parents, who are French, pursued post-secondary education. My father finished high school; my mother learned stenography at a vocational school and got her first job at sixteen. I guess this made me an ideal candidate to wear the nice T-shirt provided by the administration. But I declined. I’m not ashamed of my background, and I don’t underestimate the challenges students face when they are the first in their family to attend college. But the two occurrences of the verb “to identify” in one eight-line paragraph were clear hints that the I’m First! initiative—part of a national campaign—was pushing a new social identity: “first-gen.”</p><p>The next fall, a long article in the Cornell magazine Ezra featured administrators attesting to the remarkable progress of this new identity. Judging by their comments, first-gen persons would no longer need a button: their nature was now self-evident. One administrator spoke of the difficulty for first-generation students of “walking onto a college campus and maybe not seeing someone who looks like you.” Another suggested that the same students “benefit from having spaces in which to be themselves; to see leadership staff, other students and even artworks that look like them.” I wondered: Do I look first-gen enough? Is it okay if I wear a bow tie or a skirt? Should I speak loudly or be shy? More seriously, what if art or education are, in my view, valuable precisely as a way of becoming other? If I defy expectations, am I untrue to myself, or to the manufactured self that others think I should reclaim? The collection of presumed tastes, behaviors, desires, aspirations, and appearances that come with an externally defined identity rejects in advance anyone who doesn’t conform. “Intersectionality”—or bearing several identities simultaneously—does not change this conundrum; it simply adds additional prescriptions.</p><p>It goes without saying that what happens on my campus1\\n is in no way unique and that being a first-gen is only one relatively novel option in a continuously growing list of what every one of us is supposed to be. American academia is a hotbed of proliferating identities supported and largely shaped by the higher ranks of administrators, faculty, student groups, alumni, and trustees. Not all identities are equal in dignity, history, or weight. Race, gender, and sexual orientation were the three main dimensions of what in the 1970s began to be called identity politics. These traits continue to be key today. But affirmed identities are mushrooming. The slightest shared characteristic, once anchored in a narrative of pain, can give rise to a new group. There is now a rural identity, a peanut-allergic identity, a fat identity, an ADHD identity, and so on. Each comes with stories of humiliation or of life-threatening experiences, with demands for official recognition, with products specifically targeted to the group, and with the sort of people the writer Touré called, in Who’s Afraid of Post-Blackness?, “the self-appointed identity cops.” Whereas identity politics, as theorized four decades ago, aimed to liberate the oppressed and to oppose American capitalism, its main form today is more invested in changing the direction of domination and in multiplying restrictions. It is the social order of the day, its rhetoric ubiquitous in the neurotic centers of the American economy (universities, the media, the tech sector).</p><p>Under this regime, identities, once affirmed, are indisputable. If I say, “As an x, I think. . . ,” I am no longer voicing an opinion that can be evaluated or critiqued within a shared space of discourse; I am merely saying what I am. If you disagree with me, you may trace everything I say back to my identity before availing yourself of corresponding counterarguments: you say a because you are an x, but I am a y and I therefore believe in b. Such identities, I insist, are not emancipatory, neither at the psychological nor at the political level. We all should have the right to evade identification, individually and collectively. What’s more, identity politics as now practiced does not put an end to racism, sexism, or other sorts of exclusion or exploitation. Ready-made identities imprison us in stereotyped narratives of trauma. In short, identity determinism has become an additional layer of oppression, one that fails to address the problems it clumsily articulates.</p><p>The driving force behind the new rise of identity determinism is trivial: social media. Our willing accommodation of the flattening logic that makes complex social life tractable to computer algorithms, the constant mental reshaping to which we subject ourselves through instant communication and individualized mass media, and the profitability of selling data generated by internet users have all contributed to the success of identity politics. Rigid, constantly reenacted identities have become a new law of the market, one whose grip extends offline. The most powerful digital platforms are made for monologues or rants that elicit mechanical expressions of approval or disapproval. This type of electronic elocution is fundamentally self-centered, but the I seeking to grab attention must connect to a we in order to survive and thrive. This we is formed of the crudest commonalities, and it is, so to speak, automatic: sustained by knee-jerk reactions, memes, and viral behaviors driven by the basest stimuli. These responses are personal in the way one “personalizes” a phone or a computer, by selecting one of the few options that engineers have allowed you. The most powerful instrument of social prescription is in the hands of every soliloquist who posts on Facebook or Twitter a demand for silencing some other we. The ability for each mechanized soul to exert a miniature tyranny is daunting enough online. Offline, it has undermined institutions and given us President Donald Trump. More and more, the political realm transcribes social media’s logic of identity. This goes for the white supremacy at the core of Trumpism as well as for the identity-based clientelism of mainstream Democrats.</p><p>With their official emphasis on open-ended scholarly discussion, universities should offer a counterpoint. But American academia tends to align itself with the business world, and corporations cater to the perceived needs of their customers. In colleges, such accommodations may begin with the exclusion of dissenting voices under the pretext of protecting certain identity groups—such as by passing over works that run counter to their supposed interests. The next step is to prevent dialogue in the classroom by forbidding students to talk (this is the traditional, magisterial approach) or avoiding all conflicts and contradictions among participants, thereby confusing a college seminar with an AA meeting. (The move toward online instruction during the pandemic has encouraged professorial monologues, since the technology isn’t conducive to spontaneous discussion.) The last stage involves censoring the name of censorship. When an NYU graduate launched a petition in 2017 titled “Metropolitan Museum of Art: Remove Balthus’ Suggestive Painting of a Pubescent Girl, Thérèse Dreaming,” she insisted she was not demanding censorship (as if the latter were only a synonym for physical destruction). During the Q&A after a talk I gave last November, a university lecturer told me that “there is no cancel culture,” thereby attempting to cancel “cancel.”</p><p>It is hard to determine whether most professors, students, and administrators sincerely subscribe to current identity politics. It varies by campus, discipline, and professional role (administrators certainly tend to express their support for the new order of things). But I do know that, at Cornell and elsewhere, only a negligible minority dares to dissent publicly. This stands in sharp contrast with the initial wave of political correctness, in the mid to late 1990s, when dozens of books written by academics critiqued identity politics from Marxist, conservative, liberal, and queer perspectives. When four Columbia undergraduates wrote an op-ed in 2015 titled our identities matter in core classrooms, they were simply spelling out the majority opinion on campus. Identities matter in the classroom, and to many they are what should matter most. The students made the case for trigger warnings by pointing out that “transgressions concerning student identities are common” in the core curriculum. The Metamorphoses, they explained,</p><p>like so many texts in the Western canon . . . contains triggering and offensive material that marginalizes student identities in the classroom. These texts, wrought with histories and narratives of exclusion and oppression, can be difficult to read and discuss as a survivor, a person of color, or a student from a low-income background.</p><p>There are three interlinked ideas here. The first is that, depending on one’s own identity, one should be coddled when encountering texts (or more generally, artworks or experiences) that could be harmful. (I particularly appreciate the absolutely condescending suggestion that a low-income student is going to be hurt by classical literature.) The logical culmination of trigger warnings is a right to opt out before having any contact with the work, which undermines the whole project of education. Second, the students seem to suppose that they are asked to “read and discuss as” members of a group. This might unfortunately be the case in more and more classes, but it is incompatible with the task of interpretation in the humanities, where we should always remain capable of being touched, challenged, and above all changed by the object of study. A cardinal error when dealing with works of art or thought is to suppose that they are monolithic and in one (ideological) piece. Some are, but they’re usually the uninteresting ones, relics often of a tradition force-fed to students in the name of some correctness. For a long time, the goal was the fostering of national identities; our era is more attuned to social engineering and moral piety, with a touch of old-fashioned puritanism. Third, the students assert that “so many texts in the Western canon” are “offensive.” This is a baffling claim. In all the textual traditions I know, violence is expressed and emotions are triggered, one way or the other. A little more intellectual humility might be useful for a small group of Ivy League students in the twenty-first century presuming to determine what is acceptable in an ancient Greek tragedy, a Tang poem, or a traditional izibongo. It’s striking also that, of all the “Western” authors studied in Columbia’s core curriculum, Ovid was the center of such attacks. The Metamorphoses unfolds a theoretical argument alongside its mythological content: it insists on the crucial role of transformation. This was not exactly a majority opinion in an empire obsessed with fostering stability and what would later be named Romanitas (or “Roman identity,” if you like). Appearing as a character in Ovid’s poem, the philosopher Pythagoras asserts that “all things change.” Ovid’s point is precisely that this principle of metamorphosis shatters any rule of identity, which makes his writings incompatible with the current reverence for reified quiddities.</p><p>In 2016, English majors at Yale asked that a course on “major poets” such as Shakespeare, T. S. Eliot, and Louise Glück no longer be mandatory. Their petition stated that</p><p>a year spent around a seminar table where the literary contributions of women, people of color and queer folks are absent actively harms all students, regardless of their identity, [but is] especially hostile to students of color.</p><p>Beyond the dubious equation of bodies of texts with the bodies of their authors and what they did with them, Shakespeare’s sonnets are anything but a promotion of male heteronormativity, T. S. Eliot’s abstinence looks quite close to the asexual label included in the acronym LGBTQIA+, and Louise Glück is a woman. This January, a revamping of survey classes in art history was presented by the Yale Daily News as</p><p>the latest response to student uneasiness over an idealized Western ‘canon’—a product of an overwhelmingly white, straight, European and male cadre of artists.</p><p>In a comic mode, you may remember the 2015 banh mi affair, when there was a brief controversy over whether a version of the Vietnamese sandwich served at Oberlin College was a symptom of cultural appropriation and a dire blow to the integrity of Asian identities on campus. (Like virtually every other national food staple, such as “Japanese” sushi, “American” hamburgers, or “Italian” pasta in tomato sauce, the banh mi, whose name derives from the French pain de mie, is itself the result of culinary and cultural mixing.) A less laughable incident was the formal complaint filed against Laurie Sheck in 2019 by some of her students at the New School, after she focused in class on the discrepancy between the title I Am Not Your Negro, used by Raoul Peck for his documentary about James Baldwin, and Baldwin’s original wording of the sentence. That Sheck would herself read the so-called N-word aloud—that she would justify it as pedagogically useful—was enough to prompt an inquiry that could have led to her dismissal. (The New School cleared her of wrongdoing.)</p><p>Less prominent cases abound. In a literature class at Stanford, a colleague who wished to devote a session to Toni Morrison was challenged by several undergraduates who argued that a white faculty member should refrain from teaching work by an African-American writer. Having noticed a few years ago that most students in my classes stopped participating when we covered the history of slavery in eighteenth-century Saint-Domingue and the origins of the Haitian Revolution, I was told in private by white students that they felt they shouldn’t speak on such issues in front of black students. I pointed out to them that it was no more moral to remain silent and let the black students bear the burden of discussion. A Cornell colleague used the word “blow job” in a guest lecture he gave for a seminar on the subject of pleasure last spring; he learned in January that a now-dismissed complaint had been lodged against him by a student who considered the term derogatory to women (who, by the way, are not the only people who perform fellatio).</p><p>Formal complaints of this sort rarely have spectacular consequences, though the anxiety of being called out, the stress of public shaming, even over frivolous grievances, at best wastes one’s time and at worst leaves a permanent stain on one’s reputation. But I don’t believe that the goal is actually the removal of professors. The objective is to reach a system of self-censorship that would bind everyone in the room, eroding academic freedom. If the choice of our words, ideas, positions, and texts is conditioned by volatile mobs, if entire sets of questions are now off-limits in our classrooms, books, or labs, then we will no longer have the capacity to create or contest.</p><p>In many of these cases, naturally, the villain is a dead or old white, straight, cisgender male. Yet, a few months after the Ovid affair, a freshman at Duke University explained that he would not read Alison Bechdel’s graphic memoir Fun Home, which had been assigned to all first-year students, because he considered its depictions of same-sex relations “pornography” and contradictory to his Christian “beliefs and identity.” He quoted a thank-you note from a Muslim sophomore who told him, “I’ve seen a lot of people who just throw away their identity in college in the name of secularism, open-mindedness, or liberalism.” Modern partisans of subaltern identities might be upset to see their favorite maneuver deployed by a white male Christian student in the South. Such turnabout should not come as a surprise. Stormfront, the largest English-language online forum for neo-Nazis and white supremacists, promotes “true diversity” and the interests of the “new, embattled, White minority.” White straight males are already a minority in the United States (though one that enjoys disproportionate representation in power). For many voters, Trump’s affirmation of a wounded white identity is central to his appeal, and, unfortunately, to that of his likely successors.</p><p>It should be obvious that identity determinism is by no means a prerogative of the left, for two main reasons. First, a truly leftist position cannot subordinate the goal of collective and individual emancipation to the unconditional affirmation of a set commonality. The identities on offer often resemble varieties of what Marxists used to call “alienation,” in which individuals internalize premade representations of themselves that limit their freedom. Second, many pleas for the protection and promotion of harmed identities now emanate from the right. The two camps may be opposed on policy, but, more and more, they agree that identities should anchor politics. In her book Uncivil Agreement, the political scientist Lilliana Mason argues that Democrat and Republican are no longer ideological positions but rather identities. This is hardly democratic progress. Coupled with ubiquitous surveillance, heightened censorship, digital conformism, and educational failure, the monomania of political identity leaves the people powerless by making cooperation impossible. In such a regime, the shredding of the social fabric is inevitable.</p><p>It is worth noting that the manifesto signed in 1977 by the Combahee River Collective—the text that launched the initial theory and practice of identity politics—warned against both “separatism” and “fractionalization.” This year, Barbara Smith, one of the members of the collective, reflected on her early years of activism, saying: “We absolutely did not mean that we would work with people who were only identical to ourselves. We did not mean that.” She added that, in this respect, the way identity politics has “been used in the last couple of decades is very different than what we intended.” Back in 1989, Shane Phelan wrote the first book with the phrase “identity politics” in its title. The book ended with the following:</p><p>Identity politics must be based not only on identity, but on the appreciation of politics as the art of living together. Politics that ignores our identities, that makes them “private,” is useless, but non-negotiable identities will enslave us whether they are imposed from within or without.</p><p>Are such warnings still audible? Or do we prefer the compartmentalized world of identity mongers preaching to their own crowds and censoring their “natural” adversaries?</p><p>There is a tired objection to what I’ve written so far: that only people enjoying a dominant position could imagine escaping identity—that only they have that luxury, not the powerless people who endure daily suffering and microaggressions, especially at the hands of heteronormative, cisgender, structurally racist, and ableist men. Not quite. Let us remember, for instance, how Ralph Ellison, in Invisible Man (1952), Percival Everett, in Erasure (2001), or Reginald Shepherd, in a 2003 essay satirizing “identity poetics,” are critical, in different ways, of identity determinism without ever trying to efface their social, racial, political, or sexual inscriptions. At the end of Ellison’s novel, the narrator comes to understand “the beautiful absurdity of . . . American identity,” which leaves few other options to members of this society beyond being “blind” (as virtually all characters are portrayed, whatever their race or sex might be) or being “invisible” (like the protagonist). Erasure centers on a writer who, throughout his life, has been considered “not black enough” and rejects the very expressions “my people” and “your people.” Shepherd writes that “the impulse to explain poetry as a symptom of its author” is “a form of self-imprisonment.”</p><p>We are now so used to the association of identity claims with descriptions of harm that any questioning of the reigning ideology is assumed to come from a place of immense privilege. Yet if I wished to portray myself as disadvantaged by current standards, I could do so on at least five counts. But don’t expect me to play the scripted role of the victim. Those of us who have suffered socially for conditions we had no control over—that is, the majority of us—should not be entrapped a second time and forced to think of ourselves as defined by harm. I have been ridiculed, derided, insulted, injured, and beaten, and all that forms part of my life history. But I also have, much as any of us has, the choice of being neither defined nor contained by idiotic brutality. Have I, since childhood, been insulted with epithets such as faggot, cocksucker, and girl? Yes—though French vocabulary is even more colorful. Have I been ridiculed for being too white, owing to the paleness caused by my chronic asthma? Yes, and incidentally this abuse always came from white people, including far-right extremists. Was I bullied in elementary and middle school by other kids for being fat? Yes, I gained weight after recovering from a near-fatal case of hepatitis at age eight, and the hassle lasted for five years. Have I been bullied for other reasons? Oh yes, many: because I sucked at sports, because my parents were poor, because I did well in school, and so on. In my fifteen years in the United States, I have never gone a week without someone frowning when reading my name or asking me to repeat what I just said, as if I were unable to order a single-shot espresso in English. I have lost track of the number of times colleagues have complained that I am a weirdo, decidedly not American, not visible enough as an LGBT person. I am fine with all these statements (I am weird, I don’t hold U.S. citizenship, I don’t want to look a certain way), but they weren’t intended as words of praise. Such aggressions were real, and they were tied to a whole array of political oppressions based on gender, class, sexual orientation, skin color, mental and physical ability. None of them were fortuitous or unrelated to social circumstances. But even in elementary school, I understood that I did not have to swallow the venom or waste my life spitting it back in the face of others. My reactions have varied, but my line is simple: I am not looking for external validation. I simply refuse to identify. I am not going to dispute wrongful characterizations, and I will not apologize either. This method protects more against microaggressions than separatism or celebrations of identity ever could.</p><p>Nothing programmed me to become who I am. In fact, nothing is programming any of us. True, many things constrain us. All systems of political inequality narrow the choices of those who lie at the bottom. We should work tirelessly to overcome such limitations. But as soon as we believe that social circumstances are absolute determinations—or, worse, “what we are”—we condemn ourselves to the endless repetition of the past and to the methodical destruction of new possibilities. While emancipation cannot be achieved only through education, the latter is, quite clearly, indispensable. The free pursuit of knowledge cannot be an afterthought: neither teaching nor research should be defined a priori by the twenty-first-century catechism of political identities. Freeing oneself from the given is an unending process that lies at the core of higher education. This task concerns students and professors alike, who should constantly allow themselves to be altered by different concepts, poems, people, and events. In contrast, today’s identity politics is a false promise that is imposed on us, often in spaces of relative intellectual freedom. No university worthy of that name, and indeed no democracy worthy of that name, should urge people to retreat within the brackets of their identities.

Both mentions of the film occur in the midst of Knausgaard’s epic tangent on Hitler’s autobiography and the rise of National Socialism in Europe.</p><p>The first comes during a discussion of the conversion of Martin Heidegger and other German intellectuals to Nazism. Quoting a German journalist on how Nazism provided a “widespread feeling of deliverance, of liberation from democracy,” Knausgaard indicates the sense we can get of “this aspect of the Third Reich—the popular demonstrations, the torchlit parades, the songs, the sense of community, all of which were unconditional joys to anyone who participated—by watching Riefenstahl’s films of the Nuremberg Rally… where all these elements are present.” Precisely because Riefenstahl’s film was so meticulously staged, Knausgaard alleges, it is striking how its “content far eclipses the fact, because emotions are stronger than all analyses, and here the emotions are set free. This is not politics, but something beyond. And it is something good.”</p><p>Knausgaard does not mean “good” in the moral sense. He refers to the feelings of the people involved in the marches and parades. As he does throughout the four-hundred page section, Knausgaard attempts to reconstruct the thoughts and emotions of those who were attracted to National Socialism, under the principle that it is impossible to understand the emergence of Nazism—“the last major utopian movement in the west”—without understanding what moved the people of Germany, and later of other European countries, to embrace it. And what moved them, in Knausgaard’s view, was not the Nazis’ promise to redistribute income, or Hitler’s analysis of world affairs, or even, initially, their hatred of the Jews. What moved them was, rather, the joyful feeling of togetherness and community, of being able to transcend not only the fragmented democracy of the Weimar period but politics altogether.</p><p>“In National Socialism,” writes Knausgaard, “philosophy and politics come together at a point outside the language, and beyond the rational, where all complexity ceases, though not all depth.” Riefenstahl’s film communicates the pleasure the people experienced—how “good” it felt to them—at having escaped the quotidian chaos of their shabby republic and their trivial private lives, at being liberated from the restrictions of rationality and deliberation, at being on the brink of achieving something large and lasting, deep and simple.</p><p>A similar focus on the emotional wellsprings of Nazi politics is evident in an important but largely overlooked recent film, which opens with black and white footage from Triumph of the Will. At the beginning of Terrence Malick’s A Hidden Life, we see—in lieu of opening credits—images of Hitler in the open cockpit of a plane descending through the mist as he lands for the rally in Nuremberg, Hitler standing before a teeming square of Nazis in neat lines, Hitler riding in his cavalcade through the streets. The film then shifts abruptly to the mountain town of Sankt Radegund, in the Austrian countryside, which appears at first to exist in total isolation from the opening tableau.</p><p>Against a backdrop of green hills and blue skies, we are introduced to Franz, a farmer and father, along with his mother, his wife, Fani, and their three young daughters. There are no military parades in Radegund, and, in the consciousness of the farmers, there seems to be hardly any politics. Fani’s and Franz’s lives are consumed by their faith, their work on the land, and their family. They live in what appears to be a fairytale innocence.</p><p>The fairytale ends when Fani is shown looking skyward, alarmed at the sound of planes buzzing overhead. The war has arrived, and Franz is soon sent to a training camp for the German army. At the military camp, Franz watches quizzically as the recruits are shown filmed images—projected on an outdoor screen—of Nazis marching victoriously through foreign cities in flames. But the propaganda has the opposite of the effect it is supposed to have on Franz. When he is called to fight again, Franz informs the recruiters that he won’t go. Later, he resolves not to serve Hitler in any way.</p><p>Based on the life and letters of Franz Jägerstätter, a farmer born in Radegund in 1907, later beatified by the Catholic Church, the character cites his faith in God and his love for Fani as his inspirations for refusing to do what everyone around him does without exception and, in most cases, without hesitation. When asked to articulate his reasons, he says little; when challenged with the fact that his resistance will “change nothing,” he merely nods. Offered a chance to avoid military service if only he will sign an oath of loyalty to Hitler, Franz refuses. He is taken from his wife, mother, and daughters, then imprisoned, tortured, and eventually executed. In Radegund, his family is outcast from the community and deprived of wartime rations.</p><p>Some critics of A Hidden Life have bemoaned the film’s lack of historical detail, pointing out that hardly anything is said about concentration camps or about the intricate political circumstances that prepared the way for Nazism. According to The New Yorker’s Richard Brody, Malick uses Nazi Germany “emblematically,” as a merely metaphorical backdrop to “illustrate the ultimate clash of good and evil, the ultimate price of resistance.” Likewise, The New York Times’s A.O. Scott lamented that Nazism is “depicted a bit abstractly, a matter of symbols and attitudes and stock images rather than specifically mobilized hatreds.” These criticisms not only miss Malick’s point, they invert it.</p><p>Malick, like Knausgaard, thematizes the “symbols and attitudes” of Nazism because he perceives how central these were to the appeal of Nazism itself. The film demonstrates impressionistically what Knausgaard, with his characteristic thoroughness, lays out in voluminous excerpts of diary entries and contemporaneous accounts from the period: the “goodness” of Nazism was as much about its symbols and attitudes as it was about its policies and actions. But the appeal A Hidden Life makes as an artistic experience is the opposite of symbolic. For the contemporary viewer, the film’s power flows from the fact that, whatever political and social convulsions led to the moment when Fani cranes her neck skyward, individual Germans like Franz and Fani were confronted by a choice that remains perfectly legible today.</p><p>Some at the time may not have felt Nazism to be a choice at all. History nevertheless records that there were, without any doubt, resisters. The existence of these resisters has “proved crucial to establishing a kind of ex post facto moral compass,” writes Rand Richards Cooper in Commonweal magazine, “reminding Germans—rather in the way that the witness of passionate nineteenth-century abolitionists reminds Americans regarding slavery—that a point of moral sanity was in fact visible to some, and thus available to all.”</p><p>How does Franz achieve this moral sanity? That is the central question of A Hidden Life, and it is in how he addresses it that Malick’s critics find special cause for complaint. Scott, at the end of his review, confesses that his incomprehension of Franz’s motives may be related to his personal preference for “historical and political insight over matters of art and spirit.” It is refreshing to hear a critic be so honest about their intellectual biases. It is also revealing of the assumptions that seem to pervade the broader discussion in recent years—carried on mostly by academics and op-ed writers, as opposed to artists—about the relationship between the politics of 1930s Europe and those of our own time. But what if the capacity to appreciate the relevance of Nazism to our own time is, in fact, inseparable from our willingness to attend seriously to “matters of art and spirit”?</p><p>Knausgaard finished his novel—and Malick likely started working on his film—well before Trump took office, so it is misleading to think of their artworks as “responses” to the events of the past four years. Nevertheless, and partly for that reason, they offer a useful vantage point from which we can evaluate not only our own relation to that past, but also the limitations of the intellectual tools we have tended to turn to when trying to articulate that relation.</p><p>Beginning not long after the 2016 election with the historian Timothy Snyder’s bestseller Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century (2017), soon followed by the philosopher Jason Stanley’s How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them (2018), numerous scholars have sought to use historical analysis of the Weimar period to alert Americans to the early signs of fascistic rule. As the Trump presidency has dragged on, these urgent warnings have given way to a wide-ranging debate, including in these pages, about whether such historical analogies are warranted or appropriate.</p><p>Understood in relation to that debate, Malick’s and Knausgaard’s artistic treatments of Nazism may persuade us not of the inaccuracy or inappropriateness of such analogies, but of their utter and complete futility—at least insofar as it is claimed such comparisons can inoculate us against repetition. In their focus on the emotional pull of Nazism—its promise to liberate citizens from the frustrations and banalities of an alienated, lonely existence, to connect them with a mass of like-minded souls in “unconditional joy”—the works of Malick and Knausgaard expose us to aspects of how fascism works that it would be laughable to think could yield to academic analysis, no matter how accessibly arranged.</p><p>“Establish a private life,” warns Snyder. “Listen for dangerous words.” Do we really imagine it was advice such as this that interwar Germans lacked?</p><p>The second time Triumph of the Will comes up in Book Six of My Struggle, Knausgaard reflects that “Nazi Germany was the absolute state. It was the state its people could die for.”</p><p>Watching Riefenstahl’s film of the rallies in Nuremberg, its depiction of people almost paradisiac in its unambiguousness, converged upon the same thing, immersed in the symbols, the callings from the deepest pith of human life, that which has to do with birth and death, and with homeland and belonging, one finds it splendid and unbearable at the same time, though increasingly unbearable the more one watches, at least this was how I felt when I watched it one night this spring, and I wondered for a long time where that sense of the unbearable came from, the unease that accompanied these images of the German paradise, with its torches in the darkness, the intactness of its medieval city, its cheering crowds, its sun, and its banners… [and] I came to the conclusion… that it came… from something in the images themselves, the sense being that the world they displayed was an unbearable world.</p><p>Once again, the emphasis is on the affective allure of this “paradisiac” world, the pleasure that is involved in sublimating one’s individual will to the mythic collective. To make one feel justified in dying for one’s country is, in some sense, the greatest gift a country can bestow on an individual. And yet Knausgaard, watching the film as an adult in a liberal democracy more than seventy years later, finds it “unbearable.” What is it in this world—or, more precisely, in “these images” of it—that are so unbearable to Knausgaard?</p><p>One of the chief insights yielded by Knausgaard’s close reading of Mein Kampf is that Hitler, for all his vehement disgust with modernity, was “one of us.” He was modern and Western in the sense that he was secular yet wanted some larger meaning; modern and Western insofar as he craved something that the rationalized, bureaucratic nation-state is organized to exclude. To say that Knausgaard arrived at this insight by making an analogy between Hitler’s time and our own would be to miss its force, for the analogy presumes a distance requiring some leap of imagination—or historical scholarship—in order to bridge it. In fact, no such distance exists.</p><p>At the dawn of the twentieth century, Knausgaard recounts, large portions of Western high society “closed the door” on religion, while millions were uprooted from their communities and traditions, often settling in overcrowded cities teeming with poverty, exploitation and, soon, militarism. If we can only clear our eyes of self-serving fantasies, Knausgaard believes, we will see that we are still living, spiritually if not quite synchronously, in that century, and that its problems are still our problems. Among the largest of these is how individuals cut off from religion and tradition can satisfy their craving for meaning and transcendence, how they may connect with that “deepest pith” of human life.</p><p>Knausgaard acknowledges the salience of this problem, and also the ugliness of the ways many modern societies have endeavored to solve it. His artistic project in My Struggle may be viewed, in one respect, as an argument for art, rather than politics, as the proper place to explore the transcendent. Throughout the six volumes, Knausgaard strives to make contact with the “inexhaustible” feelings—feelings he associates with experiences of joy, beauty, plenitude, ecstasy, and reverence—that he believes are suppressed in so much of modern, secular life. In Book Six, he emphasizes that these emotions are also at work in Riefenstahl’s film, and that they speak to some of the elemental forces that drove Nazi ideology. But whereas Riefenstahl intentionally blurs the line between aesthetic feelings and political ones, Knausgaard insists on the necessity of segregating them. In contrast to the undifferentiated masses that populate Riefenstahl’s “German paradise,” the responsible modern artist anchors their artistic vision in distinctive personal experience, which they invest with what Knausgaard calls “the inimitable tone of the particular.”</p><p>But even within art, Knausgaard argues, the Nazi experiment has had its effect. So complete was the catastrophe of Nazism that it warns us not only against the danger of utopianism in politics, but also against the danger of utopianism in any collective cultural endeavor, including art. Knausgaard laments the extent to which Western art after Nazism has been oriented toward ideas (the cerebral, the critical) rather than toward the emotions (the passionate, the inexpressible), but his novel, about the life of a bourgeois man raising his family, demonstrates that even he does not wish completely to disavow this orientation. Indeed, as many critics have noted, Knausgaard surrounds his musings on the transcendent with thousands of pages documenting a man making cereal, tidying his children’s bedrooms, checking his email, and agonizing over whether he should get off the couch to make another cup of tea.</p><p>The prosaicness of My Struggle is, in this light, an act of prudence and self-limitation: while expressing his perennial attraction to the “inexhaustible” emotions, Knausgaard never forgets their danger. The long digression on Hitler—the culmination of Knaugaard’s book-length Kampf against what he takes to be his own Hitlerian impulses—ends with Knausgaard’s remembering the moment he felt most powerfully the stirrings of the “we” he associates with fascism: in the aftermath of Anders Breivik’s summer camp mass shooting outside of Oslo in 2011.</p><p>This “we” emerged amid a moment of national mourning and grief, and yet Knausgaard still perceives in it the germ of a potentially fascist collectivity. Even sitting alone, as he writes the final portion of his book from his home office in Malmö, a medium-sized city in Sweden, where he lives with his wife and his (then) three children, Knausgaard recognizes in himself a desire he identifies with Nazism: to reach beyond the dull comforts and tedious complications of bourgeois democratic life. But he also knows something the Germans marching in Riefenstahl’s film did not know, and this thing compels him to resist this desire, as it relates to politics and even to art.</p><p>What makes Riefenstahl’s film unbearable to Knausgaard is that he knows the catastrophic endpoint of the joyful, torchlit parade. We might even say My Struggle in its entirety is an investigation of the liberal-democratic self—in its nobility as well as in its banality—that has been shaped by the knowledge of where Hitler’s parade of the “we” ends.</p><p>Malick, too, knows where this parade ends, yet he comes to a conclusion different from Knausgaard’s about how art might be meaningful after Auschwitz. In a review that chided the film for its “heavy-handed moralism,” the critic Lidija Haas observed that it was “hard to tell whether it’s an intentional irony” that Malick begins A Hidden Life by showing a “fantasia” of a mountain community that a “fascist would adore.” I don’t see anything ironic about it, but Malick’s romantic evocation of life in the mountains, in a movie that begins with footage from Riefenstahl, could hardly be accidental.</p><p>Before her Nazi period, Riefenstahl both starred in and directed a series of “mountain films” that were reputedly admired by Hitler. In these films, wrote Susan Sontag in her famous essay on fascist aesthetics, the “mountain is represented as both supremely beautiful and dangerous, that majestic force which invites the ultimate affirmation of and escape from the self.” A Hidden Life also makes use of a majestic romantic imagery: the mountains shrouded in mist form the backdrop for more than one scene in which a farmer is tilling the fields at dusk. That this imagery is deployed in a film devoted to resistance to Nazism, however, might inspire us to ask whether it is necessary—or wise—to abandon the field of the emotional sublime to the fascists.</p><p>Ever since Walter Benjamin observed, in the epilogue to his much-cited 1935 essay “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” that the logic of fascism was toward “the introduction of aesthetics into political life,” Western artists have gravitated toward one of two paths. Many leftwing artists, suspicious not only of the aestheticization of politics but of any emotional appeal not immediately assimilable to their political purposes, have taken part in a counterattack that culminates, as Benjamin predicted it would, in the full “politicization of art”—that is, the reduction of art to agitprop. Liberals and many conservative writers have, on the other hand, predominantly done as Knausgaard recommended and tried to sequester aesthetics within the artistic sphere, even there taking care not to let things get out of hand.</p><p>An appreciation of the full spiritual force of movements like Nazism might encourage us to countenance a third alternative, one that acknowledged the centrality of symbolism and emotion to political life, and deployed them against the eroticized collectivism that is so evident in Riefenstahl’s film. This aesthetics would honor the triumph, we might say, not of the collective will, that threatening “we,” but of the individual conscience.</p><p>Midway through A Hidden Life is an arresting tableau: Hitler, again in grainy film footage, appears in uniform, playing with a little boy on the viewing deck of his retreat in the Bavarian mountains, the sun glittering off the mountainside behind him. The interlude—beautiful but haunting (haunting because beautiful)—underscores, just as the film’s opening does, the aesthetic and emotional appeal of the Nazi project. Malick does not shrink from this appeal, but neither does he allow it to shrink his own ambition as an artist. In a film that begins with Riefenstahl’s footage, the very worst that can ensue from the politicization of such ambitions is in full view. But A Hidden Life rather than being intimidated into modesty by fascist art, presents a countervailing utopia to the völkisch collectivist one, holding out the prospect of a different kind of “escape from the self.”</p><p>It is not incidental to Franz’s story that, for him, religion is still an open door. Christianity provides both the substance and the inspiration for the orienting world “beyond” politics in A Hidden Life. Of course, as the film depicts, plenty of churchgoing Christians were among Nazism’s most enthusiastic supporters. And conversely, the aesthetic power of Malick’s late films, even as they have grown more explicitly Christian in their imagery and message, is perfectly accessible to many of us who are not Christians. Christianity, in these films, is one among many educators of the moral sentiments, one among many reminders that ethical action is not dependent on “historical and political insight” and often will remain unmoved by it. Art can be another such educator.</p><p>“I have this feeling,” Franz tells the Nazi judge who presides over his trial. “If God gives us free will, we’re responsible for what we do—or what we fail to do. I can’t do what I believe is wrong.” Franz’s belief, like the beliefs of the fascists, is based on a feeling. This why his “resistance” has seemed opaque to those more accustomed to researching and factchecking their way to virtue, but it is precisely what gives his story its relevance in a period in which a new emotional sincerity is spreading throughout our political life, often overpowering our liberal-democratic caution about political passions.</p><p>Yet, in contrast to the fascists, Franz does not clothe his moral feeling in self-certainty; still less does he attempt to transform it into dogmatic judgment. Rather, he accepts that his decision is vulnerable to counterarguments, including those that his wife and lawyer repeatedly put before him. He could be wrong, he acknowledges to the judge, but he cannot sign the oath. It is not only fascist feelings that are, sometimes, inexpressible.</p>\",\"date\":\"2020-8-15\",\"link\":\"https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2020/08/14/the-unbearable-toward-an-antifascist-aesthetic/\",\"discrp\":\"Susan Sontag famously wrote about Leni Riefenstahl and the aesthetics of fascism.

One answer would be to “cancel” him, to dump his statue in some river and let the water erase it. This wouldn’t be without cause: calling his politics and personality repugnant is an understatement. But it would also be too simple. Pound’s fingerprints are everywhere: most famously on The Waste Land, but also on the careers of Yeats, Frost, William Carlos Williams, and H. D. (Hilda Doolittle); on the publication of Joyce’s Ulysses; on Imagism, Vorticism, and the “New Poetry” that emerged in Poetry a century ago. He was, inescapably, one of the pivotal figures of twentieth-century literature.</p><p>If we have to live with Pound, the necessary question is how: merely as a player in literary history or also as the author of literature still worth reading? Two recent—and very different—works offer their own ways of approaching him. Daniel Swift’s The Bughouse: The Poetry, Politics, and Madness of Ezra Pound (2017) guides a popular, if highbrow, readership through the decade Pound was institutionalized at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C.; while Timothy Billings’s Cathay: A Critical Edition (2019), presents a meticulously researched textual guide to the composition of Pound’s 1915 breakthrough of translations (or “translations”) from Chinese poetry.</p><p>The Foreword, Introduction, and Editor’s Introduction to Cathay: A Critical Edition make the case that we should not really read these poems as Pound’s work, per se, but “as a link in a series of compilations, glosses, and creative rewrites,” “textual collaborations” with the original authors and the many figures who mediated Pound’s encounter with them. The narrower (and admitted) goal of this approach is to circumvent the longstanding arguments about Pound’s accuracy and authenticity as a translator and to focus on his textual process of translation—all for the best. But one can’t help noticing another effect: to separate the poetry from the poet, dissolving Pound’s authorship in order to absolve the words.</p><p>Billings performs meticulous, detailed, and traditional textual scholarship: transcribing, annotating, collating. Ultimately, these labors belie the notion that Pound’s singular authorial role could ever have been a merely contingent link in textual transmission.</p><p>Cathay, Swift’s account contends, “invents modernist poetry.” Like all claims about modernism’s origins, this is an overstatement invested in literary mythology. But its point is worthwhile: in their moment, these two dozen translations from classical Chinese poetry (and the Old English “The Seafarer”) weren’t just an obscure work of antiquities. They were living poetry—something new. Of course, translates has always been a contentious verb here: Pound didn’t know much Chinese at all. Instead, he worked from the notebooks Ernest Fenollosa, an American art historian, had used to study with two Japanese scholars, Umewaka Minoru and Mori Kainan.</p><p>For over a century, critics and scholars have argued about Pound’s methods of translating, his errors and his inventions, without careful or systematic reference to the documents from which Pound worked—despite their availability in Yale’s special collections. Billings transcribes and assembles these “cribs” as the back matter to this Cathay, the bulk of the volume. The layout does present a multi-authorial snapshot: First, the Chinese characters themselves; beneath them, the romanji transliteration; then a word-by-word gloss of literal definitions; “paraphrases” offering the sense of the whole line; and, lastly, Pound’s published translation. The five layers repeat, line-by-line, for every poem, emphasizing one of Billings’s more remarkable discoveries: that Pound’s practices of translation grew out of a traditional Japanese reading practice called kundoku, or gloss-reading. It’s a three-stage process that Ernest Fenollosa’s teachers employed: read aloud one line at a time; succinctly parse each character, including multiple meanings; create an intelligible paraphrase, or translation, of the line. The result, in the notebooks, are glosses and paraphrases that often disagree by design. As Pound translated, he erred on the side of the glosses—leading to moments of insight and of error.</p><p>Billings terms Pound’s method of working from these “the calque,” or “a transfer of lexical meanings so ‘literal’ that it imposes its foreignness unidiomatically on the new text.” In the hands of a lesser poet, this could easily be as disastrous as the floridly idiomatic renderings of late-nineteenth century translations Pound both rejected and consulted. In his critique of Richmond Lattimore’s 1967 translation of Homer, “Another Odyssey,” Guy Davenport observes that “Translation involves two languages; the translator is in constant danger of inventing a third that lies between, a treacherous nonexistent language suggested by the original and not recognized by the language into which the original is being transposed.” This is the technique of Pound’s calquing—and it highlights how essential he is to the process. The third line of “Poem by the Bridge at Ten-Shin” reads, in Fenollosa’s gloss, “Morning become cut/rend intestine flowers.” Paraphrased, it’s “In the morning they are unbearably beautiful flowers.” Neither leads inevitably to Pound’s imaginative, unidiomatic, and yet far superior, “At morning these are flowers to cut the heart.”</p><p>The English language may never see another editor quite like him. The same methods he would use to chisel his “Homage to Sextus Propertius” from the Latin, various Cantos from Latin renderings of Homer or the correspondence of Sigismondo Malatesta, or The Waste Land from Eliot’s meandering “He Do the Police in Different Voices” drives his process here. If Cathay really did invent modernism, it was by honing Pound’s editorial prowess. Cathay’s textual history may have been complex and involved the collation of multiple voices, but, inescapably, it is also the work of Pound’s idiosyncratic and erratic genius. </p><p>Billings’s Pound disappears into textual history. Swift’s was never there at all: in The Bug House, the aging, institutionalized poet is a cipher for those who come to visit him at St. Elizabeths. Encounters with his contemporaries (Eliot, William Carlos Williams), rising poets (Elizabeth Bishop, Robert Lowell, Charles Olson, John Berryman, Hugh Seidel), and his doctors guide the structure of Swift’s account of Pound’s decade there—as do other, more ephemeral figures who drift onstage from the neo-fascist margins of American and Italian politics. All find in Pound what they want (and perhaps need) to find: a model of resistance to poetic conventions, an antagonist, a mentor, an elder poet also grappling with madness; a celebrity patient; an economic and political theorist whose works root out a global conspiracy of usurists (Jews, capitalists, militarists, mongrelizers, and more Jews). Insofar as it offers these narrative snapshots of a moment in literary history, this has value: Pound serving less as a forebear than as an object of cultural significance in the 1950s, like Ozymandias’s pedestal come to life, or the ruined Lady Liberty in Planet of the Apes.</p><p>But Swift frames his study as his own attempt to visit with Pound—and as ours. “Pound at St. Elizabeths is the riddle at the heart of the twentieth century,” he writes; “Pound’s contradictions remain with us. They are the uncertainties of our time.” But after 260 pages, Swift can reach no answer. Pound is contradictory. He (and his verse) probably can’t be trusted, but also can’t be dismissed. The book’s closing image is Pound, free in 1959, waiting for the director of a BBC documentary to tell him what to do: a figure whose meaning must be created by someone else. Pound is always only what we make of him.</p><p>This is the worst of all worlds: a way of accidentally absolving Pound of his sins while dismissing the poetry as at best secondary to the empty vessel of his biography. Swift makes the same mistake many of Pound’s guests did: he visits and expects to learn something. Nearly a century after the New Criticism excised author and context from consideration, we’ve come full circle, subordinating poetry to psychology, politics, and personality. This isn’t Swift’s fault; it’s the condition both of much of what passes for literary criticism and our contemporary notion of poetry as mere “self-expression,” a way to be “heard” in all your “individuality.”</p><p>But if we’re to be totally honest, Swift’s relegation of the poetry to minimal importance isn’t entirely wrong. Much of Pound’s work—including almost all of the Cantos—simply are not worth reading or investing the time and resources of scholarship. Arguments about Pound’s politics often seem like ways to skirt the question of his literary merit. We know he’s important—but is he any good?</p><p>So let’s speak plainly. Pound was a central figure of twentieth-century literary history, without whom lasting, enduring works would not have taken the shapes they did. He was a talented, innovative poet—up until his mid-thirties. But the Cantos, on which he staked his reputation, were a failure. The modernist scholar Lawrence Rainey referred to them as “The Monument of Culture.” The truth is that they were born ruins. To find beauty in them, we have to do something like what Pound did in Cathay: read the word-by-word glosses and ignore the paraphrases. The reason is this: when we do try to make sense of them, they descend too often into secrecy, paranoia, and conspiracy. It’s not that there’s no “there” there—it’s that what is there far too often isn’t worthwhile.</p><p>Pound will endure, though, because in any honest literary history he must. The poems will, too—at least some of them, the early translations like Cathay especially. Billings’s scholarship makes the case for that—and for “The Seafarer,” “Homage to Sextus Propertius,” and the first Canto. Despite the ugliness of his person, some of what Pound created remains lastingly beautiful.  </p><p>J. L.

There is little disagreement about the events of the Viking Age or its timeline, stretching from 8 June 793 (the unexpected raid on Lindisfarne) to 25 September 1066, when King Haraldr Harðráði, ‘Hard-Counsel Harald’, died at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. As Neil Price points out, all this should be seen as protohistory rather than history. The Vikings themselves couldn’t write, except for short runic inscriptions carved in wood or stone, and had no dating system beyond ‘the fourth year of King Olaf’ and so on. Royal succession was the only way to mark time. The sequence of events we refer to as the Viking Age was put together from the accounts of their many victims, from Ireland to Byzantium.</p><p>Price’s book, however, centres on ‘what made [the Vikings] tick, how they thought and felt’. How much money did they make? How much labour went into fitting out a Viking fleet? What did Vikings think happened to women when they died? (Warriors, of course, went to Valhalla.) There are clues to this last question in excavated Viking graves, but these discoveries – Price is professor of archaeology at Uppsala University – are often inscrutable. There are logistical questions too. In considering the wealth of the Vikings, it’s impossible to ignore the island of Gotland, where hundreds of hoards of silver have been found, almost one for every farm – contributing to a total of more than a million silver dirhams found in Scandinavia and the Baltic, nine times as many as have been found in their point of origin in the Muslim Near East. It’s ‘simply not credible’, Price writes, ‘that virtually all homeowners concealed their family cash in the backyard and then died before telling anyone about it’. Later accounts claim that the Vikings believed they would enjoy their buried wealth in the afterlife. The sources aren’t reliable, but it does at least explain the phenomenon.</p><p>The biggest question, of course, is what made the Vikings so successful for so long. Western Europe was dominated by warlike monarchs and aristocracies, while Muslim Spain, the Byzantine Empire and the Caliphate of Baghdad were all in their different ways organised for warfare. Price suggests that we need a prehistory as well as a protohistory. Two traumatic events affected the northern world long before Lindisfarne. One was the collapse of the Roman Empire, a destabilisation that led to a kind of ‘gangster culture’ of unemployed mercenaries and roving warbands. Even worse, and better evidenced, were the volcanic eruptions of 536, 539/540 and possibly 547. The second, which originated from Ilopango in what is now El Salvador, threw around ninety cubic kilometres of dust, ash and aerosols into the atmosphere. The entire world suffered, but Scandinavia, with its short growing season and often marginal agriculture, suffered most. It’s thought as much as half the population died of starvation. At the heart of Norse mythology is the Fimbulwinter, three winters with no summers in between, which may once have been a fact.</p><p>In desperate circumstances, the poor die but the survivors expand their holdings. The famine may well have strengthened the post-Roman militarised elites who have left their traces in the giant mounds and boat-burials of Uppsala and Valsgärde, and the enormous wooden hall at Borg in Norway, which at 270 feet long is as big as a cathedral. Another hall at Uppsala had door hinges made of spears, their points facing towards the centre, so that you entered through a weapon portal: all part of ‘a dazzling material culture of killing’. But there were few ways to pay for this in the middle of the long post-Roman slump, which entailed the disruption of established markets. Raiding must have looked very attractive.</p><p>Price also notes the significance of the Vikings’ gender imbalance. Norse society was not exactly polygamous, for monogamy was normal, but it was polygynous. Rich men and royalty had wives, subsidiary wives and concubines, sometimes, according to an 11th-century treatise by Adam of Bremen, ‘in unlimited number’. An unbalanced ‘socio-sexual economyʼ was probably made worse by the habit in warlike societies of rearing baby boys more carefully than girls, leading to female infanticide by neglect. Skeleton studies in Sweden show that about 7 per cent of Viking men were malnourished as children, compared to 37 per cent of women. Elite monopolisation and differential survival rates must have created an underclass of what we would now call ‘involuntary celibates’, disaffected young men, angry, desperate and easy to recruit.</p><p>In one of several vignettes, Price imagines a younger son on the impoverished west coast of Norway, whose childhood sweetheart has a new brooch: a present from a boy who spent a successful summer raiding. What is young Orm or Gunnar going to do? Not only does he need money for the bride-price paid to her family, he needs a reputation: ‘The act of acquiring silver was as important as the silver itself.’ And if he went raiding he might in any case acquire a woman for free. DNA has shown that ‘a very large proportion – even the majority – of female settlers in Iceland were of Scottish or Irish heritage.’</p><p>Traumatised societies, militarised elites, disaffected youths: they all help explain the Viking phenomenon. But did they think like us? Price points out that the Vikings decorated everything that had a surface, including themselves. Ibn Fadlan, the Arab traveller who met a party of the blond ‘Rus’ somewhere in Eastern Europe in the 920s – and whose horrifying account of a Viking funeral has been largely confirmed by archaeological finds – said that they were covered in what must have been tattoos. ‘Each man, from the tip of his toes to his neck, is covered in dark green lines, pictures and such like.’ No Viking skin has survived, but their teeth have. It seems there was a male fashion for filing horizontal grooves along the upper incisors, which were probably filled with coloured resin. A Viking smile must have looked very odd. But what the point of this fashion was, we don’t know.</p><p>Nor do we know what they thought about their own inner lives. Vikings recognised hamr, or ‘shape’, as more or less equivalent to ‘body’, though some people were eigi einhamr, ‘not of one shape’: they were werewolves, or worse. Hugr could correspond more or less to ‘mind’. But Vikings also seem to have thought that each of us has a hamingja, a personal ‘luck’, which can on occasion leave the body (a very bad sign). The fourth part of us is a female fylgja, a ‘follower’ or ‘fetch’, inherited from our ancestors. Price doesn’t claim to know what a ‘fetch’ does, but he writes that the belief dies hard. If you ask modern Icelanders whether they believe in elves and the huldufólk or ‘hidden people’, they will roll their eyes, but ask them about their fylgjur and you get ‘a level stare and perhaps a change of subject’.</p><p>Viking society wasn’t homogeneous. They had dealings with many different cultures and they lived in varied environments, from Danish and Swedish pasture to the sub-Arctic tundra of Norway and Iceland. In the early 11th century the best-travelled woman in the world must have been Gudrid Thorbjarnardóttir, whose remarkable journeys demonstrate the great distances the Vikings covered. She gave birth to a child in North America, met people of the First Nations and ate grapes in Vinland, made a pilgrimage to Rome and drank wine in Italy, and died as a nun in Iceland. Vikings lived in close contact with the Sámi people, whom they called Finns. In his earlier book, The Viking Way, Price pointed out that Norwegians and Swedes, at least, might be regarded as in some ways similar to the ‘circumpolar’ cultures which stretch from Greenland to Siberia, notably in what looks like shamanistic behaviour.</p><p>But the more we know about the Vikings, the harder it becomes to say anything certain about them. This applies in particular to the area for which we have most archaeological evidence – burial practices. The number of excavated Viking graves is in the low millions, and the only rule is that they’re all different. Men buried with weapons are common, but the occupant of a particularly well-furnished grave in Birka, who was buried seated with axe, sword, spears, bow and arrows, is now confirmed by DNA as female. Conversely men buried in women’s clothes and with feminine accessories have been found on several occasions, including one man buried with a full set of female jewellery near Andover. Women buried with iron staffs may have been völvur, sorceresses, practitioners of the seithr magic which was shameful for men to deal in. But Odin seems to have been the supreme exponent of just this kind of magic, so some scholars now write about ‘Odin the Queer’. Possibly, as in circumpolar cultures, all the workers of magic and sorcery were regarded as ‘differently gendered’. Shamans have a gender all their own.</p><p>It is hard to come to any overall conclusions about Viking belief from their burial practices. They performed cremation and inhumation, boat burial and barrow burial. In Sweden, birds’ eggs were often placed in cremated ashes. Burying someone with two horses could be a kind of tribute, but why bisect the horses and then swap the halves over? What explains the modest burial which, decades later, had a boat full of bodies placed over it, the keel exactly covering the grave, a ritual repeated with more boats and more men over the years? In Salme, off the coast of Estonia, two boats have been found which appear to contain forty Swedish raiders, buried displaying their battle wounds, clutching fish and birds and cuts of beef or pork. But why throw gaming pieces over them? One sword-carrier has a king placed in his mouth. Was it a mark of derision from the victors or of respect? What to make of ‘a line of burials in which every corpse clasps a smooth white pebble in their hand’? If the eggs in the ashes express hope for a new life, a hatching, then perhaps the white pebbles are symbolic eggs?</p><p>Price avoids such speculation, though we have no good explanations for this astonishing diversity. He is similarly dismissive of the idea that we can reconstruct a belief system from the ‘Norse myths’. Vikings had no accepted scripture, just stories. They had no accepted religion either, just what Price calls ‘religiolects’, differing from one another as dialects differ from a standard language. Archaeology offers harder facts and firmer conclusions in other areas. The silver hoards of Gotland are surprising enough, but they represent only a fraction of the Vikings’ take. It’s thought that as many as 125 million silver dirhams from the Caliphate of Baghdad, some 340 tonnes of metal, went north in the tenth century as payment for furs and slaves. The ninth-century payoffs from the Frankish Empire were much less substantial, but still amounted to around seven million silver pennies, a high proportion of the coins in circulation in impoverished Western Europe. The Vikings made off with ‘approximately 14 per cent of the entire monetary output of the Frankish Empire’, and that isn’t counting other kinds of loot, such as slaves.</p><p>There is also the matter of the expenditure involved in gaining the loot. Viking sails were made of greased wool and it took about fifty sheep to provide the wool for one sail. The wool had to be spun and woven: heavy, co-operative work on a great Viking loom (the ‘Song of the Valkyries’ is in the form of a work song, but the web the Valkyries are weaving from human intestines is war and death). You would be wise to have a spare sail, and the crew would need clothes and tents and cordage, all demanding more wool and grease and hemp and flax and sealskins. That would mean thirty people working for a year to fit out just one ship and its crew. The 11th-century fleets of Denmark and Norway would have required about two million sheep. As for a major warship like the one displayed at the British Museum’s Vikings exhibition in 2014, that would represent something like a year’s work for a team of eight skilled men, not counting the time taken to produce the wood and iron needed.</p><p>Price doesn’t quite describe this as a pirate economy, but he draws the parallel. In the central section of his book he offers something like a narrative history of the Viking Age, but focusing on general trends rather than single dates and events. As he sees it, the first development was ‘maritoria’, markets organised by many petty kings, especially those in geographically fragmented western Norway. These were trade centres, but were dependent on the ‘maritime military power’ exercised by leaders who bore nicknames such as ‘Cruiser’, ‘Screamer’, ‘Sails Alone’ and ‘Sails at Dusk’ (forget about ‘peaceful traders’). Even Harald Fairhair, who became a proper historical king, may have had his nickname cleaned up by later saga writers: he started off as Harald Lúfa, ‘Mophead’.</p><p>This pirate world generated what Price calls (again a term borrowed from the 17th and 18th centuries) a ‘hydrarchy’: there were no overall leaders, no pirate monarchs, and indeed no formal organisation. This made them difficult to deal with, because, as everyone soon found out, making a deal with or buying off one group of Vikings meant nothing to another. A Viking army, at least until the late stages when the kings of Denmark and Sweden (but probably not Norway) had some loose control over their subjects, was a confederation of brotherhoods bound, if at all, by temporary oaths. Gangs left and more gangs joined, depending on the opportunities available.</p><p>The ‘real catalyst’ for the big surge in Viking activity in the ninth century, Price argues, was the civil war in the Frankish Empire between the grandsons of Charlemagne. Anglo-Saxon England was already divided, and Ireland and Scotland even more so. The Vikings came in like the tide, flowing into anywhere they found a gap. In the east, the great rivers of Ukraine and Russia were like the Hudson and the St Lawrence to explorers centuries later, only these had the markets of Byzantium and Baghdad at the end.</p><p>Such​ parallels remind us that the Vikings, for all their strange customs and unknowable psychology, were more like us than we might like to admit. But there was something macabre about them. Adam of Bremen describes the strange rituals at Uppsala, where men and animals were hanged in large numbers in a sacred grove as sacrifices to the gods. Something like this has been discovered at Frösö, or ‘Frey’s Island’, in Sweden: the stump of a birch tree buried under the church altar, surrounded by human and animal bones and body parts, including those of pigs and sheep, as well as six elks and five bears. Did they even hang bears from sacred trees?</p><p>Viking funerals may have been scary affairs as well, and not just for the victims. The craftsmanship of the objects found in the Oseberg boat-burial has been much admired, but the ceremony seems to have been completed in terrible haste, as if the burial party panicked. The chamber was sealed with any old pieces of wood that were handy, hammered in so fast that the wood was dented and the nails bent or broken.</p><p>Patrick Wormald once commented that Vikings rarely seemed to have suffered from madness, though there were psychopaths like Thorgeir Hávarsson, who is said in ‘The Saga of the Fosterbrothers’ to have axed down one innocent bystander just because he looked so temptingly open to the blow. They had a code of honour. In 1012 Thorkel the Tall, a famous captain, is said by Thietmar of Merseburg to have offered everything he had, except his ship, for the life of the captured Archbishop Ælfheah of Canterbury, who had refused to pay a ransom; when Ælfheah was killed anyway, pelted with bones and finished off with an axe, Thorkel changed sides and took his men off to serve Æthelred the Unready. Perhaps he thought killing a defenceless old man was ódrengiligt, not warrior-like behaviour.</p><p>A recent scholar, considering the appalling scene of gang rape and slave murder at the Rus funeral described by Ibn Fadlan, claimed that this ought to put paid to the idea that the Vikings were heroic: they were just cruel. This is naive. Heroism and cruelty are mutually exclusive only in the world of comic books. As Price’s book makes clear, they have often gone together.</p><p>\\n                The Editor \\n                London Review of Books, \\n                28 Little Russell Street \\n                London, WC1A 2HNletters@lrb.co.uk\\n                Please include name, address, and a telephone number.\\n            </p><p>  ‘There is little disagreement’ over the timeline of the Viking Age, Tom Shippey writes (LRB, 13 August).

Shame can crush an individual. It can pick up on a passing mistake and amplify it beyond recognition, with no clear end point. It can, quite literally, drive a person to death. There is no question that shame has become a genuine emotional problem in the age of social media, arguably one of the most pressing emotional issues in American society today.</p><p>The #MeToo movement has made it clear that for too long shocking behaviors have persisted in casting rooms and television studios, highlighting the vital importance of shaming in bringing these offenses to light. Add to this four years of a President who has no clear moral compass, and the need for shame in various facets of American life becomes abundantly clear.</p><p>The dilemma, if briefly stated, is inescapable: It is possible to make an almost equally compelling case for a need for more shame and for a need for less shame in the contemporary United States. Many of the same people eager to bemoan the shaming of certain individuals pile on relentlessly in shaming other behaviors. There may be no emotion, currently, that is at once so ubiquitous and so disputed.</p><p>Part of the problem, of course, is the familiar issue of intense partisanship. It is easy to identify hapless victims of shaming by the other side, while blithely engaging in the same emotional strategy in hopes of bringing that same other side to its knees. Liberals eager to jump to the defense of Lewinsky or a victim of gay-bashing show little mercy when it comes to an utterer of the n-word or an excessively randy co-worker. Not surprisingly shame may seem just fine when deployed on behalf of your own values; it’s lack of agreement on values that causes much of the problem, and we have no fix in sight.</p><p>Beyond this, however, there is confusion about the meaning of shame itself, and this is where a further discussion of where this emotion stands in contemporary American life might prove quite helpful. There is no magic solution to the problem of shame—partly because there is no imminent solution to the nation’s deep cultural divide. But a look at the various faces of shame will perhaps suggest some effective ground rules.</p><p>Two preliminaries help set the stage. First, Western society (not just the United States) is unusual in its disdain for shame. While shame has been modified almost everywhere—no society widely uses the public stocks anymore to humiliate offenders—many regions continue to accept the legitimacy of shaming as a matter of course. The Chinese, for example, openly use shaming in school discipline: In one televised episode, a boy who had damaged some school equipment was made to wear a tawdry “shaming sweater” for the rest of the day to highlight his misdeeds before his classmates. A comparable strategy in the United States would almost certainly bring a level of parental protest that would get a teacher fired. Polls of East Asian parents show a near-majority agreeing with the importance of shaming children, while the same scenario elicits essentially no support in the United States.</p><p>In evaluating the complexities of contemporary American shame, it is really useful to be aware that alternatives exist. They have clear drawbacks: Shaming societies tend to generate greater conformity, possibly a greater reluctance to innovate, and currently their proclivities can feed authoritarian political systems. But the American dilemma is not a universal one, and it has its own downsides.</p><p>Indeed, the Western campaign against shaming is itself a modern phenomenon, and this is the second preliminary to keep in mind. Before the late 18th century, there is no indication that West European or North American approaches to shaming were at all distinctive. But Enlightenment emphasis on the dignity of the individual generated a radically new approach—and one that continues to shape much of our thinking today. It was an American founding father, Benjamin Rush, who articulated the new wisdom most clearly in stating, in 1787, that “shaming is universally acknowledged to be a punishment worse than death.”</p><p>The revolutionary sentiment, furthermore, was not just idle talk. Within a few decades American states began abolishing the age-old institution of public stocks. Parents were urged to avoid using shaming in child discipline, because of the potential for damaging self-esteem (a modern term first used in the 1850s). A bit more gradually, schoolteachers incorporated some of the same wisdom, abolishing classic practices like the dunce cap.</p><p>The point is clear. The contemporary concern about the damage shame does has been recognized for quite a while, though it is distinctively modern and disproportionately Western. The result has been a measurable diminution in a host of behaviors that once seemed commonplace. And the anti-shame movement has steadily added momentum: the shaming of unwed mothers or gays, to take two vital examples, has visibly diminished, again with Western societies usually in the lead.</p><p>The precedent of attacking shame in the name of individual dignity has of course been greatly enhanced in recent years. Testimony of individuals like Monica Lewinsky joins with the publicity given to tragedies such as the suicide of a Rutgers student publicly identified as gay by a roommate. Psychologists studying shame uniformly point to its (usually) harmful results. Convicted criminals who are shamed often relapse in part because of their resentment of the emotional burden—in contrast to those exposed to the kind of guilt that can be addressed through better behavior. Fat shaming more often than not drives individuals to eat more, in response to this needless emotional distress. Currently, amid the coronavirus pandemic, evidence suggests that attempting to shame people who refuse to wear masks simply makes them more defiant. Shame elicits pushback from both individuals and groups who find the emotional attack both painful and unwarranted.</p><p>At least in a Western context, where individuals are taught to resent shame, evidence mounts that the emotion is not only offensive in principle but counterproductive in practice. It is tempting simply to join the chorus, perhaps noting the progress that has been made but emphasizing the work still to be done to achieve greater agreement that shaming is bad.</p><p>There is, however, another avenue to explore, and because it is somewhat less familiar it demands more attention than the more commonplace case against shame.</p><p>We can begin with the obvious flip side of the emphasis on the longstanding modern credentials of the attack on shame: If shame has been under scrutiny for more than two centuries, why has it survived so well? Why does the problem continue to seem so pervasive?</p><p>Several explanations may combine. Some people are simply nasty and enjoy the opportunity to inflict harm on others. Modern technologies have visibly increased opportunities for random shaming, often directed against individuals with whom the attacker has no personal contact. An individual tweets a flippant comment while visiting Arlington National Cemetery, and a host of counter-tweets swarm, some truly outraged, others simply delighted at the opportunity to cause pain. There is little question that social media have made shaming a greater problem.</p><p>Then there are conservatives who simply do not buy into the fashionable dismissal of shame. In recent decades some American jurists have argued that shaming is a vital means of punishing certain kinds of offenders, from shoplifters to drunk drivers. Some parents agree, like the father who registered his daughter’s disobedience on Twitter (the issue was choice of clothing), ultimately causing her suicide. Even relatively moderate politicians like Jeb Bush have publicly mused that it would be good to restore shaming to inhibit adultery and other behaviors that threaten family life.</p><p>Add these factors together—the innovations of the Internet, nastiness, sincere conservative concerns—and a part of the dilemma is resolved. The offensive against shaming has encountered a variety of impediments, which is arguably all the more reason to press it forward more vigorously.</p><p>This is not, however, the whole story. Shaming also persists because it serves vital social functions and because, even in contemporary Western society, it can work, or at least seem to work. This other side to the argument, focused on shaming not so much as individual punishment but as social practice, is what makes the current issue so complex—and so intriguing.</p><p>We need to step back from the personal impact of shame—while not forgetting about it—and take a different look at the emotion. After all, if most human societies routinely used shame for centuries, and some still do, there may be something to the phenomenon beyond misguided venom.</p><p>In this light, the purpose of shame is the expression of group values that cannot be adequately implemented by other means—such as force of law. The group itself may enhance its sense of identity and cohesion through shaming, but the main point is the effort to enforce rules that are at once important and resistant to more bureaucratic mechanisms. Further, while shame unquestionably punishes and causes pain, its fundamental purpose is not punitive but preventive. Shaming seeks to reduce undesirable behaviors by making the adverse emotional consequences abundantly clear.</p><p>This is why, against popular impression, successful shaming regimes actually do not have to shame very often. The classic Puritan impulse to shame adulterers, for example, was only rarely deployed because of widespread awareness of potential community reaction. This means, in turn, that the pain involved was far less common than often imagined.</p><p>It is the social function of shame, and the way it can play out in practice, that most fundamentally explains why shaming continues to occur even in a cultural context that is in principle hostile. Three scenarios suggest some of the ongoing results.</p><p>First, in some cases, even today, the disciplinary function of shame is not easy to replicate by other methods. Schools offer a prime example. American teachers have clearly learned that extreme shaming is no longer acceptable. But faced with limitations on other forms of discipline—corporal punishment most obviously—and confronted with situations where more positive appeals to pride and self-esteem do not fully suffice, mild shaming may seem an inescapable option. Thus many school districts feature daily evaluations of students, expressed through colored stars made public to classmates and parents: green for good behavior but red for bad. The “bad”, pretty clearly, is meant to be remedied or, even better, prevented through the impact of mild shame.</p><p>Second, shaming plays a seemingly vital role in efforts to enforce human rights internationally, where no other reasonable measures seem available. Amnesty International thus routinely relies on shame to induce governments to rescind harsh punishments (like stoning for adultery) or release imprisoned union leaders. Shaming was central to apparently successful campaigns to induce Nike to change exploitative labor practices in Southeast Asia during the 1990s. To be sure, some governments resist global shaming—for example, the United States in its 2003 invasion of Iraq, or China with its oppression of its Uighur minority more recently—but the effort will surely continue.</p><p>Third, shaming can still seem essential in the domestic realm, where deeply-held principles confront the inadequacy of purely legal implementation. Thus anti-abortion groups feel intensely compelled to shame women as they head into a clinic, hoping as well to deter others from even showing up. Black Lives Matter, though using laws and courts where possible, openly cry shame to mobilize public support against police abuse, bringing a long tradition of invoking shame against racism into the contemporary era. Shaming is also deployed against other signs of racism, such as use of the n-word, punishing individual offenders but, even more, seeking to deter misbehavior in future. Shaming of this sort undergirds much of so-called cancel culture.</p><p>The conclusion is clear: Shaming is awful; it is desirable; its extremes can be disciplined; it is inevitable.</p><p>There is a final complexity to add to the mix before we talk about ways in which irreconcilable features can be, partially, reconciled.</p><p>Shame may have a particular role in modern democracies, in supplementing voting as a means of disciplining, or attempting to discipline, political behaviors. This is a relatively new angle, provoked by some of the disruptions of the Trump presidency, but it deserves some exploration.</p><p>Traditional monarchs, essentially by definition, were above most public shaming. Only egregious loss in war might threaten the kind of public outcry that could disgrace a king. On the other hand, many monarchs were constrained by codes of honor with an established upper class, where shaming might be deployed.</p><p>Modern authoritarian regimes use shame abundantly to punish dissent. The famous show trials of Soviet Russia were prime examples of shame-supported discipline. But there are more contemporary instances as well. The rulers themselves, however, rise above shame, often more blatantly than monarchs did, either through misinformation or sheer assertions of power.</p><p>Democracies might seem to have little need for shame as a political instrument, given the discipline of the ballot box. But clearly many democracies have sought to use shame as a supplement—for example, in both Britain and the United States, in seeking to enforce some standards of sexual morality or financial ethics on political figures between elections. Shaming may also be essential where regional political figures should be brought to account even when their own constituencies remain complacent: In the summer of 2020 for example, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez worked, with the classic goal of punishment and prevention, to shame a Florida Republican for using sexist language, even though the majority of his own district was unconcerned. Shaming may be a vital supplement in seeking responsible political behavior in a democracy.</p><p>Today, however, democratic shaming is challenged by the emergence of an elite class, “masters of the universe” types, who glory in their immunity to shame. Their attitude was perfectly encapsulated by a German financier who noted, quite simply, “shaming is for sissies.” This is the kind of attitude that fueled the misbehavior by banks and Wall Street that led to the 2008 financial crisis, and that has been embodied by Donald Trump, an ardent shamer who accepts no shame himself. The combination of shame, democracy, and claims of special exemption add yet another component to the evaluation of this complex social emotion.</p><p>How, then, does all this add up, beyond the obvious fact that it seems unrealistic, possibly undesirable, to claim hostility to every form of shame and at the same time clearly unacceptable to welcome shaming with no boundaries or concerns?</p><p>No tidy compromises emerge. One of the reasons for discussing shame is to highlight the kind of complex, ambiguous problem that invites contemplation and debate rather than decisive formulas.</p><p>Some conclusions can be ventured, however. The first is the most familiar from the anti-shame school. It is vital to remember how painful shame can be, a pain often exacerbated and prolonged in the age of social media. Compassion and moderation are essential. The lessons are all the more essential in situations where the shamers feel deeply that their cause is morally vital—which means shame from the liberal as well as the conservative side. The need for care applies in all directions. The many experts who urge the downsides and frequently counterproductive qualities of shame deserve careful attention.</p><p>This is all the more true in that shame now so often carries arguably excessive economic consequences, with companies ready to abandon any employee, vendor, or client who brushes with shame without much regard to the clarity or magnitude of the offense. The caution on the liberal side is also enhanced by the need to recognize that, rightly or wrongly, the American heartland already feels shamed by the coastal elites for higher levels of religious devotion and other qualities that arguably are not legitimate emotional targets. This does not mean that shaming for offenses on the right need be abandoned—there is little chance of that in any event, given the passions involved—but that there is extra need for moderation.</p><p>The wounding qualities of shame deserve consistent attention. This is even true in international relations, for there are clear examples of shaming efforts that worsened national behavior, just as there are counterexamples in which shame has provoked human rights reform. We know enough about shame in a variety of contexts to be careful, especially when we feel particularly righteous.</p><p>This said, shaming the little guy, of whatever political persuasion, warrants more care, particularly when social media are involved, than shaming the powerful or, even more obviously, the corporate. While it remains important to be accurate, and to be open to explanation, the importance of shaming in dealing with corporate misbehavior, often backed by consumer response, is particularly clear-cut in the contemporary world. The power and resiliency of the target matters.</p><p>Contemporary shamers, however justified, also need to be reminded of the importance of reintegration, a concept quite familiar in societies that are more comfortable with shame but which risks getting lost in the current American or Western context.</p><p>For it has become all too easy to assume that a shamed individual is branded for life, regardless of the precise nature of the offense or of efforts at apology and rehabilitation. To be sure, some tough individuals have written of their ability to live through shame: a tenured professor, for example, who inadvertently sent pornography to a class managed to live it down after a few years. But they have often done so from a protected position.</p><p>More generally, once we recognize that some shaming is inevitable, we can more clearly remember that, depending on the magnitude of the offense, shaming should usually have a clear end point. After the Chinese student mentioned earlier wore the sweater for most of the day, he was explicitly allowed to take it off before class was dismissed—a sign that he had paid his dues and could reenter the community. Similarly Hester Prynne of The Scarlet Letter was ultimately allowed to take her letter off, though she chose not to do so. Reintegration may seem hard to contemplate for targets of current opprobrium such as office-place sexual abusers or individuals guilty of racist language, but it is vital to consider how second chances might be allowed—particularly in those common shaming situations where no formal trial or defense has been involved. Along with initial moderation and compassion, reintegration offers an opportunity for balance in an emotional/social equation that can easily become unbalanced.</p><p>At the same time, particularly in a society so heavily weighted toward the rich and powerful, we must be deeply wary of individuals or groups that seem to be immune to shame, whether openly or not. Just as some shaming is inevitable and productive, so the ability to feel shame, and even better the capacity to anticipate shame in advance of a misdeed, is a vital component of responsible behavior in a contemporary democracy. “Shameability” should clearly be added to the qualities of good character we seek to identify in political or corporate leadership. We can start by recognizing that we seem to have a problem in this regard.</p><p>Just as I would want to raise a child without relying heavily on shame—a child who also learns the bad effects of shaming the vulnerable—so I would also want a child who had enough experience with shame as to feel it and wish to avoid it. Understanding of these complexities must start fairly early in life.</p><p>Shame can play a vital role in helping to guide good behavior, even though, when hauled out for specific notice, it has a lot of bad press. At the same time, it can clearly incline toward excess, making the righteous feel even better than they merit, particularly in a society more comfortable with condemning shame than examining it carefully. Anti-shaming efforts, even under the ironic banners of “shame the shamers,” are often fully justified.</p><p>We must also recognize contemporary issues that have made the classic Enlightenment attacks on shame more complicated: the pervasiveness of the Internet and the lack of agreed-upon manners for its use; the intense partisanship that so complicates moderation in virtually every category; and the existence of a group that seems to rise to power by taking delight in ignoring shaming constraints. All of this warrants attention in discussing the role of shame in the United States today.</p><p>Some shame, however, is with us to stay. The continued deployment of the emotion despite 250 years of criticism is a fact that simply must be acknowledged. Shame is part of group life. Appropriately handled, it can help regulate behaviors that might otherwise run unchecked. It plays a role in dealing with racism. It should serve as a moderating force in political life. And it will surely factor into any effort to promote responsible stewardship of the environment. This is why, along with due care, it deserves recurrent discussion as a constructive force, including its role in the kind of improvements we should be aspiring to in the next phase of our political life and in the evaluations of contemporary leadership.</p>\",\"date\":\"2020-8-11\",\"link\":\"https://www.the-american-interest.com/2020/08/03/why-we-dislike-shame-and-cant-get-enough-of-it/\",\"discrp\":\"Shame has been under scrutiny in America for more than 200 years.

The coming months would be, she proclaimed, a “Summer of Faulkner,” focused on three of his novels—As I Lay Dying, The Sound and the Fury, and Light in August, available in a special 1,100-page box set weighing in at two pounds. Oprah’s website posted short videotaped lectures by three literature professors to assist readers in making sense of the writer’s notoriously demanding prose. The Faulkner trilogy quickly rose to the No. 2 spot on Amazon’s best-seller list. Some literary critics hailed Winfrey for bringing William Faulkner back into popular consciousness; others challenged any notion of recovery or revival, asking whether he had ever really gone away.</p><p>In the decade and a half since then, the issues of race and history so central to Faulkner’s work have grown only more urgent. How should we now regard this pathbreaking, Nobel Prize–winning author, who grappled with our nation’s racial tragedy in ways that at once illuminate and disturb—that reflect both startling human truths and the limitations of a white southerner born in 1897 into the stifling air of Mississippi’s closed and segregated society? In our current moment of racial reckoning, Faulkner is certainly ripe for rigorous scrutiny.</p><p>Michael Gorra, an English professor at Smith, believes Faulkner to be the most important novelist of the 20th century. In his rich, complex, and eloquent new book, The Saddest Words: William Faulkner’s Civil War, he makes the case for how and why to read Faulkner in the 21st by revisiting his fiction through the lens of the Civil War, “the central quarrel of our nation’s history.” Rarely an overt subject, one “not dramatized so much as invoked,” the Civil War is both “everywhere” and “nowhere” in Faulkner’s work. He cannot escape the war, its aftermath, or its meaning, and neither, Gorra insists, can we. As the formerly enslaved Ringo remarks in The Unvanquished (1938) during Reconstruction-era conflict over voting rights, “This war aint over. Hit just started good.” This is why for us, as for Jason and Quentin Compson in The Sound and the Fury (1929), was and again are “the saddest words.” As Gorra explains, “What was is never over.”</p><p>In setting out to explore what Faulkner can tell us about the Civil War and what the war can tell us about Faulkner, Gorra engages as both historian and literary critic. But he also writes, he confesses, as an “act of citizenship.” His book represents his own meditation on the meaning of the “forever war” of race, not just in American history and literature, but in our fraught time. What we think today about the Civil War, he believes, “serves above all to tell us what we think about ourselves, about the nature of our polity and the shape of our history.”</p><p>The core of Gorra’s book is a Civil War narrative, which he has created by untangling the war’s appearances throughout Faulkner’s fiction and rearranging them “into something like linearity.” From the layers and circularities and recurrences and reversals of Faulkner’s 19 novels and more than 100 short stories, Gorra has constructed a chronological telling of Yoknapatawpha’s war, of the incidents and characters who appear in the writer’s extended chronicle of his invented “postage stamp” world. Faulkner took liberties with the historical order of events; what he sought to depict was the “psychological truth of the Confederate home front” and the war’s aftermath. This is work, Gorra argues, that actual documents of the period would be hard-pressed to do. And that psychological truth certainly could not have been derived from study of the racist historiography of Faulkner’s era, which he insisted he never even read. Instead, this understanding is the product of what Toni Morrison once called Faulkner’s “refusal-to-look-away approach” to the burden of his region’s cruel past.</p><p>Faulkner enacts this refusal through his practice of looking again, of revisiting the same characters and stories, and through the prequels and sequels and outgrowths of those he has already told, digging deeply into the hidden and often shocking truths of the South he portrays. Gorra endeavors to unknot and clarify Faulkner’s oeuvre by reconstructing it himself, but his act of literary explication is also one of participation—a joining in the Faulknerian process. Gorra renarrates these Civil War stories as he seeks to come to terms both with America’s painful racial legacies and with William Faulkner.</p><p>Perhaps the most powerful of Faulkner’s tellings of the Civil War story is Absalom, Absalom! (1936), a novel structured around Quentin Compson’s own refusal to look away. Although Faulkner insisted that Quentin did not speak for him, Gorra has “never quite believed him.” Quentin’s search to understand why Charles Bon was murdered during the very last days of the war unfolds through his elaboration of successive narratives in a manner not unlike Faulkner’s own. Unsatisfied with each version of the story he uncovers, Quentin looks again, arriving through ever more disturbing revelations at the South’s original sin: the distorting and dehumanizing power of race. It is race that pulls the trigger. “So it’s the miscegenation, not the incest, which you cant bear,” Bon says just before Henry, at once his brother and his fiancée’s brother, shoots him.</p><p>To think of this novel appearing in the same year as Gone With the Wind is startling. It was moonlight and magnolias, rather than a searing portrait of the persisting legacies of slavery, that captured the public’s acclaim: Margaret Mitchell, not Faulkner, won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1937. But Faulkner’s period of “explosive productivity,” beginning in 1929—13 books in 13 years—attracted a different sort of attention, because of his formal innovations and literary experimentalism, not just his unvarnished portrayals of race. In a 1939 essay, Jean-Paul Sartre compared him to Proust, and Faulkner became an idol in the eyes of young French intellectuals as well as literary critics around the world. Faulkner might not have won the Pulitzer, but he was on the path to his 1949 Nobel.</p><p>Gorra notes the “ever-increasing importance of race” in Faulkner’s fiction. Yet society’s racial attitudes and practices were evolving even more rapidly than Faulkner’s own. As the civil-rights movement gained momentum after the end of World War II, Faulkner engaged in more explicit public commentary about America’s divisions and inequities. Like critics in those years and ever since, Gorra struggles to come to terms with the distressing views Faulkner frequently articulated on questions of racial progress and racial justice. Gorra does not look away from Faulkner’s troubling public statements or from some disconcerting stereotypes and assumptions in his literary work that became newly jarring as social attitudes shifted.</p><p>A great deal is at stake in Gorra’s effort. We are in a time when authors’ reputations are overturned, their works removed from reading lists, their achievements devalued because of their blindness on questions we now see with different eyes. At the outset of his book, Gorra reminds us of persisting debates over Joseph Conrad, initially stimulated by a 1977 Chinua Achebe essay labeling him an apologist for imperialism. Today, Gorra believes, Faulkner “stands to us as Conrad does,” in need of reexamination and an updated understanding that confronts his racist shortcomings.</p><p>Faulkner, Gorra concedes, “remained a white man of the Jim Crow South and did not always rise above it. At times his words both can and should make us uncomfortable.” His fiction offers an “all-too forgiving depiction of slaveholder paternalism.” His novels and stories fail to render slavery’s physical cruelties; they include no depiction of an auction, a family separated by sale, or a whipping. Many of his Black characters seem incomplete, although they’re certainly not the caricatured stereotypes typical of so much white southern writing of his time. Faulkner remarked upon white men who had “the courage and endurance to resist … Reconstruction.” The Unvanquished presents John Sartoris as a leader of the local Klan admirably determined to keep “the carpetbaggers from organizing the negroes into an insurrection,” which was Sartoris’s view of the Black claim on the franchise. As Gorra observes, Faulkner’s “picture of black voters as inevitably ignorant and corruptible simply parrots the view of Reconstruction that was current in Faulkner’s childhood and for some decades thereafter.” A 1943 short story Faulkner wrote for The Saturday Evening Post presents the slave broker and Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest in a generous manner that Gorra finds particularly “hard to stomach.” At the same time, Gorra points out, the depiction of enslaved people fleeing to freedom and securing their own emancipation transcends the historiography of Faulkner’s time and anticipates that of our own. He is no apologist for the Old South, and resists in any way glorifying the war, unlike almost every other white southerner of his era.</p><p>The public pronouncements Faulkner made on race as the civil-rights movement unfolded are in many ways even more disturbing than the shortcomings Gorra identifies in his fiction. In an appalling drunken interview with the British Sunday Times in 1956, Faulkner invoked the specter of race war if the South were compelled to integrate, but when his words were widely reviled, he denied ever having uttered them. He regularly spoke out against lynching and deplored the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, saying that any society that murdered children didn’t “deserve to survive, and probably won’t.” But he had once suggested that mobs, “like our juries … have a way of being right.” Gorra underscores the “incoherence” of Faulkner’s position as both critic and defender of the white South’s resistance to change.</p><p>In many ways, he was a quintessential white southern “moderate,” an identity much scrutinized as the civil-rights movement gathered momentum. He condemned violence and recognized the need to end segregation, but he rejected what Martin Luther King Jr. later described as “the fierce urgency of now.” Indeed, it was the moral failures of just such moderates that King would directly assail in his 1963 “Letter From Birmingham Jail.” Faulkner urged patience and delay and spoke out against federal coercion of the white South. His critics thought he should have known better. As James Baldwin explained in a 1956 essay condemning his views on desegregation, Faulkner hoped to give southern whites the time and opportunity to save themselves, to reclaim their moral identity. But their salvation could come, if at all, only at the cost of postponing justice for Black Americans, which Baldwin made clear was no longer conceivable.</p><p>Gorra assembles quite a bill of failings, especially if we view Faulkner with the assumptions of our time and place rather than his own. Yet having meticulously acknowledged all of this, Gorra makes his claim for Faulkner the writer by reproving Faulkner the man. “When writing fiction,” Faulkner “became better than he was.” He had, Gorra argues, an uncanny ability to “think his way within other people,” to inhabit their being so as to erase preconceptions and prejudices in the very act of portraying their minds and souls. Through fiction, Faulkner could “stand outside his Oxford, his Jefferson, and see the behavior his people take for granted, the things they don’t even question.” As Gorra presents it, the act of writing bestowed an almost mystical clear-sightedness. Yet that clarity was always challenged in the fetid Mississippi air that Faulkner, like all his characters, had to breathe. And it is that very tension, the combination of the flaws and the brilliance, that for Gorra makes his case.</p><p>Is this rendering of Faulkner’s weaknesses as the source of his strength just an act of interpretive jiu‑jitsu? Or perhaps a reversion to a romantic notion of redemptive genius? Or is Gorra influenced by what Faulkner himself urged upon posterity: that his life be “abolished and voided from history,” leaving only “the printed books”? After all, Faulkner once declared that he wanted his epitaph to read “He made the books and he died.”</p><p>But Gorra insists on the importance of the teller and the tale, as well as on the creative force Faulkner derived from the burden of race, which he could not escape. It is because of, not in spite of, Faulkner’s shortcomings that we must continue to engage with his work: These failures are product and emblem of the legacies of racial injustice that shape us all. In his Nobel Prize speech in 1950, Faulkner declared that the only thing worth writing about was “the human heart in conflict with itself.” He lived that conflict even as he wrote about it. His struggles forced him to experiment and to innovate, yielding both his aesthetic and his ethical insight. These very difficulties—“the drama and … power of his attempt to work through our history, to wrestle or rescue it into meaning”—are what make Faulkner so worthwhile. We read him because he takes us with him into our national heart of darkness, into the shameful history we have still failed to confront or understand. Our past, Gorra and Faulkner agree, is “never over.” Or certainly not yet.</p><p>We want to hear what you think about this article.

Born in 1743 to a wealthy landowning family, he was sketchily educated at Harrow, Eton and Oxford. His father died when he was 18, and he came into his inheritance three years later, living for the rest of his life off the rents from large estates in the Lincolnshire fens, Derbyshire and Staffordshire. Banks had about £6000 a year when he started out, and, through aggressive fen-draining, enclosure, improvements in sheep husbandry, and a prudential marriage in 1779 to an heiress with holdings in Kent, was worth £30,000 per annum at his death in 1820. That made him one of the richest men in England; he could do what he liked; and what he liked to do was to travel and collect.</p><p>The usual late 18th-century itinerary for polite travelling and collecting was the Grand Tour, but the young Banks had a different idea. (‘Every blockhead does that,’ he said. ‘My grand tour shall be one round the whole globe.’) At Eton, he had discovered a love of botany (as one does). He followed Linnaeus’s new programme of systematic classification; and he looked for ways to spend a lot of time exploring and collecting plants. Around 1766, an opportunity presented itself that would allow Banks to combine heroic natural history with the most unusual and grandest of all tours. The Royal Society was lobbying the Admiralty to send a ship to reach the South Seas in 1769, in order to observe the Transit of Venus, the passage of the planet across the face of the Sun. Competent observation of this event would enable accurate determination of the distance between the Earth and the Sun, and of the size of the solar system. There would not be another Transit of Venus until 1874. The navy agreed that the voyage would be worthwhile (the measurements would help with map-making), and it emerged that there was a secret government plan to find out whether the long-speculated Terra Australis Incognita – the great undiscovered Southern continent – really existed; if it did, to take possession in the name of King George III; and if it didn’t, to plant the flag on whatever still unknown lands were encountered in the circumnavigation.</p><p>The Royal Society would organise the astronomy, securing a grant from the king to pay for it; the navy would be responsible for the ship, commander, crew, stores and victualling. The vessel was the bark Endeavour; the commander was the bluff, 39-year-old Yorkshireman James Cook, who was also an able astronomer. No one had thought to add natural history to the workload, but Banks got wind of the plan and thrust himself forward. He secured his place on the Endeavour by pulling strings – Lord Sandwich, a former first lord of the Admiralty, was a friend, a fishing companion and Fenlands neighbour – and by spreading money about. Banks’s personal paid-for entourage for the voyage included the talented Swedish botanist Daniel Solander; a Finnish draughtsman and cataloguer; two artists (to make drawings and paintings of specimens and landscapes); and four servants from his Lincolnshire estate (two of them black). His luggage included a pair of greyhounds, a dog and a bitch called Lady (for hunting); a skiff (for netting marine specimens); a vast quantity of paper (for dried plants); glass cases, boxes and bottles; high-end optical instruments; fishing nets and tackle; a small arsenal of pistols, rifles, shotguns and ammunition (for sport and science); and supplementary food and drink up to gentlemanly standards – beer, porter, wine, apple pies, an excellent Cheshire cheese. The sum Banks laid out for salaries, supplies and kit was enormous – perhaps between £6000 and £10,000 – about £2 million in current money. He always travelled in style. On a later – and much shorter – jaunt to Iceland, Banks assembled a team of 17, including three liveried servants, a Malay he had brought back from the Endeavour voyage, a gardener, a French chef and two French horn players. A new set of Wedgwood Queen’s Ware china was packed for onshore entertainment.</p><p>During the three years of the Endeavour’s voyage, planting the flag and tagging the plants co-existed. The Transit of Venus was observed in Tahiti on 3 June 1769. The mathematically challenged Banks had little part in the observation, though an engraving produced later was captioned: ‘Mr Banks shows the Indians the Planet Venus on the Sun.’ Islands west of Tahiti were mapped and claimed for the Crown; later, Aotearoa (‘New Zealand’ to the pakeha) and the east coast of Australia were added to the imperial inventory (the naming of ‘Botany Bay’ indexed the joined-up enterprises of natural history and empire-building). The tropical botanising was everything Banks had hoped for. He returned to London with a haul of more than thirty thousand plant specimens, many then unknown to European science, and a thousand – less successfully preserved – fish, birds, molluscs, insects and other animals. What later came to be called ethnographic materials were also haphazardly collected: cartloads of cloaks, weapons, utensils and assorted ‘rarities’, picked up all along the way from Tierra del Fuego to the Indian Ocean.</p><p>There was very often a scientific purpose to the collecting – it’s always good to find new species – but there is no missing the sheer delight Banks took in going about it. Banksian collecting involved tramping, climbing, shooting and fishing. He was a plant hunter as much as he was a collector. Later in life, Banks would get fat and gouty, but in his twenties he was a fit and active sportsman. He also collected people. Departing Tahiti, he took onboard the Tahitian Tupaia and his young companion Tayeto. Tupaia was a highly skilled open-sea navigator, an invaluable Polynesian go-between, and the kind of man whom Banks recognised as the local version of a gent – ‘certainly a most proper man, well born’. Cook didn’t want him on board, but Banks decided to take him at his own expense. ‘Thank Heaven,’ Banks wrote in his journal, ‘I have a sufficiency, and I do not know why I may not keep him as a curiosity as well as my neighbours do lions and tygers at a larger expence than he will ever probably put me to.’ In the event, his Tahitian curiosities didn’t make it back to Britain; they both died of malaria in the East Indies.</p><p>In 1774 another British voyage to the South Seas returned with a striking Ra’iātean called Mai (known to the English as ‘Omai’). Banks introduced him to London society, and he soon became a must-see metropolitan attraction. Joshua Reynolds painted his portrait and William Parry did an ensemble piece of Mai, Solander and Banks. Mai met the king, Dr Johnson and Fanny Burney; a play about him was performed at the Theatre Royal; he learned to play chess and backgammon, and many agreed with Mrs Thrale’s comment about the ‘savage’s good breeding’. Banks delighted in showing him off: an aristocratic friend commented that Banks seemed ‘to keep him as an object of curiosity, to observe the workings of an untutored, unenlightened mind’. Mai indicated that he would like to learn to write, but Banks made no effort to oblige him. After Mai returned home, Banks carefully reclaimed his hospitality costs from the government: £317 11s 11½d.</p><p>When Banks returned to London in 1771, he was a very great celebrity. He had been around the world and brought much of it home, where you could ask permission to see it at his house in Soho Square. Within months of his return, his uncle commissioned two fine portraits. The American expat Benjamin West painted him wearing a splendid Māori flax cloak, standing among a striking assortment of South Sea trophies, and his friend Joshua Reynolds underlined the point by posing the romantically unwigged young Banks with a globe and a seascape in the distant background. His left hand rests on a pile of letters, the uppermost bearing an inscription from Horace: ‘Cras Ingens Iterabimus Aequor’ (‘Tomorrow we’ll sail the vasty deep once more’). Everybody wanted to meet Banks; everybody wanted to see the spoils of his voyage. He had been elected to the Royal Society even before the Endeavour voyage and now he was admitted to its inner circles. There were sparkling dinner parties; he became a member of the taste-defining Society of Dilettanti and the Society of Antiquaries; and he was presented to the king, soon becoming a royal favourite and trusted adviser to the agriculturally obsessed ‘Farmer George’.</p><p>Banks came back a cad as well as a hero. Botany in the Linnaean mode was already considered a louche science in the late 18th century – all that unwholesome prying into the sex lives of plants – and the Encyclopaedia Britannica announced that ‘obscenity is the very basis of the Linnaean system.’ London satirists drew cartoons of Banks as a foppishly affected ‘Botanic Macaroni’ and as ‘The Fly Catching Macaroni’, while Gillray produced ‘The Great South Sea Caterpillar, Transform’d Into a Bath Butterfly’. But Banks brought a special frisson to the figure of the botanising voyager. There was talk in London about the obligingness of Tahitian women and about Banks’s sporting ways, which his Journal did little to deny, bragging that ‘he had tasted Womans flesh in almost every part of the Known habitable World.’ Later, he reported that in Tahiti ‘Love is the chief occupation’ and that ‘Both the bodies and souls of the women are moulded in the utmost perfection for that soft science.’ London wits responded with ribald satire. One series spoofed his presumed relationship with the queen of Tahiti – though his Journal insisted that he much preferred her younger companion – and the anonymous poem ‘Mimosa’, dedicated to Banks, played on the idea of his ‘sensitive plant’, growing in stature in tropical conditions: ‘The plains of Otaheité ... rear this plant to an amazing height’:</p><p>The historical career of the notion of the natural-living, free-loving, noble savage passes through Tahiti, from Rousseau by way of Banks and the besotted crew of HMS Bounty to Paul Gauguin.</p><p>And there were much gossiped about passages of dodgy behaviour on home soil. Departing on the voyage to the South Seas, Banks left behind a young lady, Harriet Blosset, so convinced he had made a promise to marry that she spent three years knitting waistcoats for him. On his return, Banks did not hurry to see her and, her family inquiring what was up, explained that he didn’t feel quite ready for marriage. He apparently settled on the unhappy Blossets a sum rumoured to be about £5000 – plus reimbursement for waistcoat materials. The bad behaviour persisted. Before his marriage to the heiress, there was at least one long-term mistress, an unacknowledged child, and a string of casual engagements with prostitutes patronised by other members of the libertine Hellfire Club. In 1776, David Hume reported that Banks and Sandwich had gone fishing, joined by ‘two or three Ladies of pleasure’. Everybody knew this sort of thing about Banks, and there’s no evidence that he much minded the satires or that they did him any damage. Wealth has its privileges.</p><p>Banks was chronically seasick, but he was keen nonetheless on a repeat performance, lobbying to join Cook’s second expedition to the South Seas in 1772. Full of himself, he pushed hard for upgraded accommodations, an even larger entourage and bulkier baggage. This time, he pushed too hard: the Admiralty baulked, and Cook left without him, stopping at Madeira to pick up a travelling companion Banks had arranged to meet there. The companion – identified as a ‘Mr Burnett’ – was surprised that Banks wasn’t onboard, and Cook too was surprised, straightfacedly judging that ‘Every part of Mr Burnett’s behaviour and every action tended to prove that he was a Woman’ – as it happened, one of Banks’s mistresses, who then had to beat a retreat back to England. Apart from a hastily arranged expedition to Iceland and a trip to the Netherlands, Banks remained on land for the rest of his life.</p><p>The​ period immediately following his return from the circumnavigation was the great inflection point of Banks’s career. Toby Musgrave, in his new biography, marks that point by telling the story differently before and after. From Banks’s birth to his return on the Endeavour, the mode is chronological and the manner is heroic narrative. Afterwards, the story is thematically organised – accounts of the various projects in which ‘the multifarious Mr Banks’ was involved and the institutions with which he was associated until his death in 1820. That seems about right. Banks was 29 years old when he left off voyaging, and the rest of his life was something very different from what it had been.</p><p>Banks’s life and works have been well documented. (Musgrave says that he is ‘a curiously neglected figure in his native country’, but that’s not quite true.) There was a thorough biography in 1988 by the scientist Harold Carter; Patrick O’Brian’s Life, published a year earlier, was a well-researched and ripping yarn, as you’d expect from the author of the ‘Aubrey/Maturin’ romans fleuves, in which a character based on Banks appears; two excellent accounts from the 1990s by the historian John Gascoigne situated Banks in the context of the English Enlightenment and the empire; Neil Chambers in 2007 contextualised Banks in the history of collecting; Patricia Fara has a rollicking go at Banks as an exploitative imperialist in Sex, Botany and Empire (2003); Banks gets a chapter to himself in Richard Holmes’s much praised The Age of Wonder: How the Romantic Generation Discovered the Beauty and Terror of Science (2008); and there is another shelf-full of standard biographies and popular treatments going back to the 19th century. As well as biography, there are accounts of Banks’s expeditions, his administrative and institution-building roles, his activities as an improving landowner and as a Crown servant.</p><p>The Australians have kept Banks (and Cook) close to the centre of their historical sensibilities. If history had taken a slightly different turn, the Lucky Country (and not just the plant genus) could have been known as ‘Banksia’ – a suggestion seriously made by Linnaeus’s son. There has been a Royal Society conference devoted to him, and recently he has been a focus of wide-ranging academic discussions about the importance of writing the history of globalised science, of exchange relationships, and of the development of connections between science, commerce and statecraft. The many followers of Bruno Latour recruit him to illustrate the notions of ‘cycles of accumulation’, ‘centres of calculation’, the global circulation of ‘immutable mobiles’ – maps, charts, paper representations of plants and animals – and the extension of power by collapsing the distant world to the dimensions of a table-top.</p><p>Musgrave comes to Banks from a background in garden design and garden history, and his book’s centre of gravity is Banks’s role in plant collection, exchange and transplantation. What The Multifarious Mr Banks lacks in pizzazz and historiographic ambition it makes up for in detail, enthusiastic admiration of its subject and commitment to repairing a calumny-damaged reputation. It relates exactly how many species Banks collected at each point in his travels and from those whose travels he later sponsored, how many of these were hitherto unknown, how many proved to be ‘type specimens’, how much Banks laid out (to the shilling) in supporting his network of plant hunters, the – actually, quite fascinating – techniques he devised for getting potted plants from one end of the Earth to another, and, despite his best efforts, how frustratingly often everything was lost. (Moving paper representations around the world was hard; moving seeds and, especially, living plants was infinitely harder. Even bringing back dried plant specimens wasn’t easy: Banks and Solander brought along bulk quantities of printers’ waste proofs of Addison’s Notes on ‘Paradise Lost’, preserving plant samples between its loosely bound pages.)</p><p>Against the charge that Banks had unpleasant racial views, Musgrave offers a range of defences: Banks had, on the whole, sympathetic relations with native people (he was fascinated by tattooing and almost certainly got himself tattooed on Tahiti); he was, Musgrave says, a sympathetic ‘ethnographer’, who gave a ‘detailed anthropological account’ of Polynesians; the occasional shootings of Tahitians, Māori and Australian aboriginal people were the result of ‘misunderstandings’ and ‘cultural differences’, unfortunate accidents, some of which the diplomatic Banks tried to prevent; when he himself was compelled to use ‘lethal force’ against the natives, he felt bad about it, being ‘a compassionate man with a strong moral conscience’; the reason for his commitment to colonisation was basically ‘philanthropic’; and the disastrous effects of contact between Europeans and native people – about which Musgrave has only the barest minimum to say – are, in the event, not to be held against any individual.</p><p>In some of these defences, Musgrave has a point: there’s little reason to think that Banks was worse, in certain respects, than the European average. Some of the others, however, are a stretch. In pressing hard for penal settlements in Australia, he claimed that the land was ‘thinly peopled’ by an ‘extremely cowardly’ population of a ‘timid Disposition’; their interests and concerns were not elsewhere considered. Musgrave concedes that Banks’s remark about keeping Tupaia as a pet and ‘curiosity’ was ‘crass’, ‘culturally insensitive’ and (as we now say) ‘inappropriate’, but adds that this was just the way many ‘upper-class British males’ then thought about ‘a remote island culture’. Banks evidently believed that slavery was a bad idea, but the arguments against it did not rest, he insisted, on moral or religious principles, ‘which are in my opinion incapable of being maintaind in argument, but on Commercial ones which weigh equaly in moral & in immoral minds’. Slavery would eventually die a natural death on economic grounds, though Banks reckoned that it persisted because black people were ‘endowed with a much less proportion of mental vigor than the whites’; they would work only when coerced; and, anyway, a slave well treated is happier than a free person with a ‘choice only of bad masters or none’.</p><p>‘When at sea, sail; when on land, settle,’ the proverb has it, but, his travels finished, what would Banks settle down to do? He would arrange and house his collections; he would preside over the London residence where the objects now lived and manage access to them; he would correspond extensively with interested parties, sometimes writing fifty letters a day; he would improve his Lincolnshire estates and increase the rents; and he would marry someone suitable. But along the way, he would figure out how to turn his networks, and his financial and material assets, into a way of life that spanned the globe, that built and expanded imperial power.</p><p>Banks’s London life and his global reach were shaped by the metropolitan institutions he influenced or controlled. After his return from the South Seas, and then Iceland in 1773, Banks said that ‘I livd in no particular station till ... I was elected President of the Royal Society.’ He had made known his interest in the position; he secured it in 1778, aged just 35; and he ruled for the next 42 years – the longest serving president ever. ‘Banks was not a leading scientist,’ Musgrave writes; indeed, you could say that he was not a ‘scientist’ at all. He knew a lot about plants and animals, but he published little; his much awaited Florilegium – a picture book of plants collected on the Endeavour expedition – was continually promised and continually put off, the British Museum producing a complete edition only in 1990 (an affordable selection appeared in 2017). Musgrave gently scolds Banks for his ‘deplorable failure’ to complete botanical projects and to publish results. He never wrote anything in the Royal Society’s Philosophical Transactions, but the fellows knew what they were doing when they elected him. A French flatterer said that Banks was an academy all by himself, but the relevant point isn’t how much knowledge Banks had but how many knowledgeable people he knew and knew how to recruit. He was a great fixer, an enabler, a patron, a networker, an organiser and an administrator.</p><p>His Endeavour celebrity was cash in the bank for that career; he was in correspondence with a worldwide web of naturalists; he was generous with his own funds; and he was extremely well connected at court. (Banks successfully lobbied for a baronetcy after securing the Royal Society presidency; in 1795, the king insisted that he become a knight of the Order of the Bath, the red sash of which he delighted in wearing when taking the Royal Society chair; and in 1797, he entered the inner circle of Crown advisers as a privy councillor.) He left behind a trail of acrimony over his despotic tendencies, and resentment from physicists and mathematicians about undue influence by amateurs, mediocrities, utilitarians and ‘Macaronis’. But his regime effected long-lasting ties binding all sorts of science to state power. When he died, an obituary observed that Banks had given ‘science a home in the courts of greatness’.</p><p>Banks exchanged youthful adventure for project management, a life of excitement for one of worldwide consequence. The big project was mercantilist imperialism. A species of economic importance was discovered in one part of the world, then brought back to the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, the powerplant at the centre of a growing network of colonial botanic gardens, of which Banks was the de facto director. If an exotic plant could thrive in Britain, that was good, but if it couldn’t, the plant might be moved to other parts of the far-flung empire and its products imported to the home islands. Botany would do as much as any other science to make Britain Great. New Zealand flax could become a source of naval cordage and Australasian timber could be turned into naval masts; grapevines and citrus trees could be moved from Europe to New South Wales, making the colony self-sufficient or even a source of supply for Britain; seeds from Peruvian cinchona trees could be grown in British India to ensure a steady supply of quinine, with which to fight malaria. Banks thought up one of the earliest British plots to steal tea plants, and abduct skilled tea-workers, from China and ship them to British Assam where an imperial tea industry could be started up and the drain of silver from the Exchequer to China plugged.</p><p>The most celebrated instance of Banksian imperial botany was the large-scale transfer of Tahitian breadfruit trees to the West Indies, there to feed plantation slaves more efficiently and at lower cost than the plantain and yam diet they were used to. Captain Bligh sailed off to Tahiti in the Bounty, where the crew were predictably enchanted and yearned to stay on. Bligh heroically survived the mutiny, but the breadfruit trees – thrown overboard – did not. Undeterred, Banks pressed for a second expedition and the Tahitian trees were successfully delivered to Jamaica and St Vincent, where they flourished – though the slaves found the taste unpleasant.</p><p>Some of Banks’s projects to change political and economic realities by moving living things around the world were striking successes. He arranged for the theft of fine-wool Merino sheep from Spain: the result transformed Britain’s flock and laid the foundations for the huge Australian sheep industry. Other projects bore fruit only after his death, and some never came to anything. But the intentions became institutions of scientific statecraft and the global transfer of living things did indeed ‘shape the world’. A friend once flattered Banks: ‘Wide as the world is, traces of you are to be found in every corner of it.’ Some of those traces are Banks-branded places, geographical features, plants – towns in Australia, islands in the South Pacific and Canada, mountains, headlands, peninsulas, bodies of water, 173 species of the Banksia genus, which once grew only in Australia but are now in domestic gardens all over the world, and the ‘Big Bad Banksia Men’ of May Gibbs’s children’s books, which have infiltrated the ids of generations of Australians. Global Banks marks the extent of once global Britain. The man himself lies in an unmarked grave – which he requested – in a church under the flight path to Heathrow. And the definitive Chantrey-sculpted statue stands in the Natural History Museum in South Kensington – where it belongs, and where it’s safe.</p><p>\\n                The Editor \\n                London Review of Books, \\n                28 Little Russell Street \\n                London, WC1A 2HNletters@lrb.co.uk\\n                Please include name, address, and a telephone number.\\n            </p><p>\\n            The Editor\\n            London Review of Books\\n            28 Little Russell Street\\n            London, WC1A 2HN\\n            letters@lrb.co.uk\\n            Please include name, address and a telephone number\\n        </p><p>\\n                            Read anywhere with the London Review of Books app, available now from the App Store for Apple devices, Google Play for Android devices and Amazon for your Kindle Fire.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFor highlights from the latest issue, our archive and the blog, as well as news, events and exclusive promotions.\\n                        </p>\",\"date\":\"2020-8-8\",\"link\":\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n16/steven-shapin/keep-him-as-a-curiosity\",\"discrp\":\"In the 18th century, botany was a louche science.

I wrote them to try to convey some ideas to you. These are not the first words I wrote for you—those were worse. I wrote and rewrote, with a view to clarifying my meaning. I want to make sure that what you take away is exactly what I have in mind, and I want to be concise and engaging, because I am mindful of competing demands on your time and attention.</p><p>You might think that everything I am saying is trivial and obvious, because of course all writing is like this. Writing is a form of communication; it exists to be read. But that is, in fact, not how all writing works. In particular, it is not how academic writing works. Academic writing does not exist in order to communicate with a reader. In academia, or at least the part of it that I inhabit, we write, most of the time, not so much for the sake of being read as for the sake of publication.</p><p>Let me illustrate by way of a confession regarding my own academic reading habits. Although I love to read, and read a lot, little of my reading comes from recent philosophy journals. The main occasions on which I read new articles in my areas of specialization are when I am asked to referee or otherwise assess them, when I am helping someone prepare them for publication and when I will need to cite them in my own paper.</p><p>This tells you something about academic writing, and how deeply it is shaped—mostly not at a conscious level—by the refereeing process. The simple fact is that “success” in academia is a matter of journal-acceptance, which in turn makes for a line in one’s CV. The number of such citations, taken together with the prestige of the relevant journals, is what counts for getting, keeping and being promoted in an academic job.</p><p>“Counts” being the operative word. What can be counted is what will get done. In the humanities, no one counts whether anyone reads our papers. Only whether they are published, and where. I have observed these pressures escalate over time: nowadays it is unsurprising when those merely applying to graduate schools have already published a paper or two.</p><p>Writing for the sake of publication—instead of for the sake of being read—is academia’s version of “teaching to the test.” The result is papers few actually want to read. First, the writing is hypercomplex. Yes, the thinking is also complex, but the writing in professional journals regularly contains a layer of complexity beyond what is needed to make the point. It is not edited for style and readability. Most significantly of all, academic writing is obsessed with other academic writing—with finding a “gap in the literature” as opposed to answering a straightforwardly interesting or important question.</p><p>Of course publication is a necessary step along the way to readership, but the academic who sets their sights on it is like the golfer or baseball player who stops their swing when they make contact with the ball. Without follow-through, what you get are short, jerky movements; we academics have become purveyors of small, awkwardly phrased ideas.</p><p>In making these claims about academic writing, I am thinking in the first instance of my own corner of academia—philosophy—though I suspect that my points generalize, at least over the academic humanities. To offer up one anecdote: in spring 2019 I was teaching Joyce’s Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man; since I don’t usually teach literature, I thought I should check out recent secondary literature on Joyce. What I found was abstruse and hypercomplex, laden with terminology and indirect. I didn’t feel I was learning anything I could use to make the meaning of the novel more accessible to myself or to my students. I am willing to take some of the blame here: I am sure I could have gotten something out of those pieces if I had been willing to put more effort into reading them. Still, I do not lack the intellectual competence required to understand analyses of Joyce; I feel all of those writers could have done more to write for me.</p><p>But whether my points generalize across the humanities or not, I will confess that I feel the urgency of the problem for philosophy much more than for some abstract entity called “the humanities.” I love Joyce, I love Homer, but I am not invested in the quality of current scholarship on either. It’s philosophy that I worry about.</p><p>When I am asked for sources of “big ideas” in philosophy—the kind that would get the extra-philosophical world to stand up and take notice—I struggle to list anyone born after 1950. It is sobering to consider that the previous decade produced: Daniel Dennett, Saul Kripke, David Lewis, Derek Parfit, John McDowell, Peter Singer, G. A. Cohen and Martha Nussbaum. In my view, each of these people towers over everyone who comes after them in at least one of the categories by which we might judge a philosopher: breadth, depth, originality or degree of public influence. Or consider this group, born in roughly the two decades prior (1919-1938), remarkable in its intellectual fertility: Elizabeth Anscombe, Philippa Foot, Stanley Cavell, Harry Frankfurt, Bernard Williams, Thomas Nagel, Robert Nozick, Richard Rorty, Hilary Putnam, John Rawls. These are the philosophers about whom one routinely asks, “Why don’t people write philosophy like this anymore?” And this isn’t only a point about writing style. Their work is inviting—it asks new questions, it sells the reader on why those questions matter and it presents itself as a point of entry into philosophy. This is why all of us keep assigning their work over and over again, a striking fact given how much the number of philosophers has ballooned since their time.</p><p>And it’s not just a matter of a few exceptional figures. A few years ago, I happened to browse through back issues of a top journal (Ethics) from 1940-1950—not an easy decade for the world, or academia. I went in assuming those papers would be of much lower quality than what is being put out now. Keep in mind, this is a time when not only was publication not required for getting a job, even a Ph.D. was not required; there were far fewer philosophers, and getting a paper accepted at a journal was a vastly less competitive process.</p><p>In general, I would describe the papers from that decade as lacking something in terms of precision, clarity and “scholarliness,” but also as being more engaging and ambitious, more heterogeneous in tone and writing style, and better written. Perhaps some amount of academic competition is salutary, but the all-consuming competition of recent years, it appears, has been less productive of excellence than of homogeneity and stagnation. Because the most reliable mark of “quality” is familiarity, the machine incentivizes keeping innovation to a minimum—only at the margin, just enough to get published. It constricts the space of thought. Over time, we end up with less and less to show for all the effort, talent and philosophical training we are throwing into philosophical research. If I wanted to make progress on one of my own papers, I’d certainly be better served with a paper from Ethics in 2020—I’m much more likely to want to cite it. But if I were just curiously browsing for some philosophical reading, I’d go for one of those back issues. We might be hitting more balls today, but none of them is going far.</p><p>Some see a way out: they call it “public philosophy.” But it is a mistake to think that this represents an escape from the problem I am describing. We do not have two systems for doing philosophy, “academic philosophy” and “public philosophy.” “Public philosophy,” including the piece of it you are currently reading, is written mostly by academic philosophers—which is to say, people who studied, received Ph.D.s at and in the vast majority of cases make a living by working within the academic philosophy system.</p><p>I have no objection to applying the title “philosopher” broadly, including to those public intellectuals who have had so much more success in speaking to a general audience than I or any of my colleagues who operate more strictly within the confines of academic philosophy: from Judith Butler and Bruno Latour to Slavoj Žižek, Camille Paglia and Steven Pinker. But it is one thing to be a “philosopher” in the sense of being a source of intellectual inspiration to the public, or a subset thereof, and another to be a member of a philosophical community. The latter designation requires a person not only to be beholden to such a community argumentatively, but also calls for participation in the maintenance and self-reproduction of that community through education, training and management. Academic philosophy is the system we have. You can’t jump ship, because there’s nowhere to jump.</p><p>The sad thing about being stuck reading narrow, boring, abstruse papers is not how bad they are, but how good they are. When I am enough of an insider to be in a position to engage the writer in back-and-forth questioning, either in speech or in writing, that process of objection and pushback tends to expose a real and powerful line of thought driving the piece. Philosophers haven’t stopped loving knowledge, despite the increasingly narrow confines within which we must, if we are to survive, pursue it.</p><p>Some in the philosophical community will defend this “narrowing” as a sign of the increasingly scientific character of philosophy. But no matter how scientific some parts of philosophy become, the following difference will always remain: unlike science, philosophy cannot benefit those who don’t engage in it. Philosophical technology—ideas, arguments, distinctions, questions—cannot live outside the human mind.</p><p>One doesn’t need to idolize Socrates, as I happen to, to think that philosophy is an especially dialogical discipline. All academic work invites response in the weak sense of “there is always more to be said,” or “corrections welcome,” but philosophical talks, papers and books specifically aim to provoke, to incite, to court pushback and counterexample. Our task is not to take some questions off humanity’s plate, but to infect others with our need to find answers.</p><p>The philosopher is an especially needy kind of truth-seeker. Like vampires, zombies and werewolves, we are creatures who need company, and who will do whatever it takes to create it.</p><p>No one thinks that Plato, Descartes, Kant and the rest were right about everything; nonetheless, centuries and millennia later, we cannot stop talking not just about them, but to them, with them. They made us into one of them, and we need to keep paying that forward.</p><p>In the interest of encouraging more philosophical writing like this, consider subscribing to The Point. Use the code PERISH this week for 25% off your first subscription (with 3 print issues and unlimited online access).</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIf you liked this essay, you’ll love reading The Point in print.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</p><p> The events of the past year, culminating in the massacre this month, have blunted my ability to make any sort of rational or moral meaning…   </p><p> Every human death feels unnatural.

In 1999, the philosopher Donald\\nDavidson caught his brilliance by coining the term the “Ramsey Effect”: when\\nyou discover that your exciting and apparently original philosophical discovery\\nhas already been presented, and presented more elegantly, by Frank Ramsey.</p><p>The 1920s were to be\\nRamsey’s only window in which to make his contributions. When the decade began,\\nhe was a seventeen year old, starting his mathematics undergraduate degree at\\nTrinity College, Cambridge. Before he graduated, he had demolished John Maynard Keynes’s new theory of objective probability\\nrelations; made a valiant attempt at repairing a defect in Russell and\\nWhitehead’s Principia Mathematica; translated\\nWittgenstein’s enormously difficult Tractatus\\nLogico-Philosophicus from German to English; and published a critical\\nnotice of the Tractatus for the journal Mind, which still stands\\nas one of the most challenging commentaries of that influential book. </p><p>This was a stunning run for an undergraduate. Keynes was building an economics empire at King’s and he knew a good thing when he saw it. In an impressive show of administrative skill and sleight of hand, he snapped up the young prodigy before Trinity could blink. Ramsey became a mathematics Lecturer and fellow of King’s College in the autumn of 1924. The next half of the decade would be even more productive than the first. </p><p>Ramsey didn’t let Keynes down. He wrote two papers in economics for Keynes’s Economic Journal. Each was so important that when the Journal celebrated its 125th anniversary with a special edition in 2015 of its thirteen greatest hits, the editors decided that both Ramsey’s papers needed to be included. “A Contribution to the Theory of Taxation” founded the sub-field of optimal taxation and laid the foundation for the field of macro-public finance, so much so that any research problem about optimal monetary or fiscal government policy is now called a Ramsey Problem. “A Mathematical Theory of Saving” tried to determine how much a nation should save for future generations and founded the field of optimal savings and development. </p><p>Ramsey also wrote, but didn’t publish, a paper in which he was the first to set out the theory of subjective probability and utility theory that now underpins much of the social sciences and Bayesian statistics. Another paper, which was published, contained a profound mathematical theorem that showed that in large but apparently disordered systems, there must be some order. That became Ramsey Theory, a fruitful branch of pure mathematics, with many still-unsolved problems and important applications in decision-making theory, communications theory and information retrieval in computer science. It is often explained to undergraduates via the Party Problem, which asks what the minimum number of guests is such that at least n will know each other. And in philosophy, he came up with important ideas that are now enshrined in terms including Ramsey Sentences, Ramsey Conditionalization, Ramsification and Ramseyan Humility.</p><p>It might seem that Ramsey was a dour thinking-machine, churning out a quantity and quality of work that left no time for life. Yet the opposite is true. He was that rarity among so-called geniuses – genial, open and modest. He was, as his brother, the Archbishop of Canterbury Michael Ramsey, put it, “very accessible to his fellow human beings”; he had “a total lack of uppishness”. “Never a showman”, said Ivor Richards, one of the founders of the new Cambridge school of literary criticism. Wittgenstein recounted that when he was working as a schoolteacher in a small village in Austria, Ramsey came to visit. In one of the classrooms there was a physiological diagram on the wall designed to show that certain “bad habits” could give one an enlarged heart. Ramsey opined that a pupil’s ambition should be to have as big a heart as he could.                       </p><p>Ramsey’s own heart was outsized, as were his laugh and his physical stature. His head, said the philosopher Richard Braithwaite, was pentagonal and his smile gentle; his “enormous physical size” was perfectly in proportion to “the range of his intellect and his devastating laugh”. Patrick Wilkinson, a colleague of Ramsey’s at King’s College, said that “He shook with laughter”. This genial young man was not going to miss out on anything. As an undergraduate, he was a member of the secret Cambridge discussion society, the Apostles, during one of its most vital periods, in which Russell, Keynes, G. E. Moore, Lytton Strachey, Lionel Penrose (the founder of British genetics) and others discussed and debated. He was active in the Guild Socialist movement. He then went to Vienna for six months, in order to overcome his sexual anxieties with the help of a psychoanalyst who had been a student of Freud’s. Immediately on his return to Cambridge to take up his King’s position, he asked a woman whom he had admired during sessions of the Moral Sciences Club and the Heretics Society, Lettice Baker, to tea. One thing quickly led to another and they soon married and had two beloved daughters. Lettice would become a renowned portrait photographer. The marriage was an open one, as both Lettice and Frank (but Lettice especially) were enmeshed with the Bloomsbury set of writers and artists, and keen on its freedoms. The marriage enabled Frank to have another great love in his life – the influential architect and reformer of social housing, Elizabeth Denby. He was an active hill climber, tennis player and swimmer. Ramsey died in January 1930, at the age of twenty-six, probably from Weil’s disease, a liver infection caught by swimming in the river Cam.                        </p><p>In addition to Keynes, Moore, Russell, Richards, Strachey and Wittgenstein, his intellectual circle included the philosopher Moritz Schlick; the economists Arthur Pigou and the young Richard Kahn; and the mathematicians G. H. Hardy and John Littlewood. While they each knew and admired a slice of Ramsey’s thought, it was Keynes who best understood the whole of his mind. In Keynes’s obituary of his young friend, he said that Ramsey and Wittgenstein had started off by helping Russell to perfect the system of Principia Mathematica. The effect was: </p><p>gradually to empty it of content and to reduce it more and more to mere dry bones, until finally it seemed to exclude not only all experience, but most of the principles … of reasonable thought. Wittgenstein’s solution was to regard everything else as a sort of inspired nonsense … Ramsey’s reaction was towards what he himself described as a sort of pragmatism … Thus he was led to consider “human logic” as distinguished from “formal logic”.</p><p>The fact that much of Ramsey’s work was highly technical and that much of it was unfinished at his death has resulted in many thinking, wrongly, that he shared in a common project with Russell, the early Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle – the project of searching for pure and unadulterated foundations for thought and action. While there are differences between the various philosophers who aimed at this broad goal, they all argued that a meaningful proposition can be reduced to its simple components, each of which will mirror or correspond or latch onto a simple object in the world. This is why their positions sometimes attract the label the correspondence theory of truth. On this account of truth, many propositions that seem highly important are not even meaningful or at least struggle to be so. These include the propositions of ethics, philosophy and much of what is important to science, such as universal generalizations and inductive conclusions. Wittgenstein’s famous last words in the Tractatus tried to justify his use of all that philosophy in the previous pages:</p><p>My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.)</p><p>Keynes knew that\\nRamsey was after something more “human”. Ramsey is well-known for delivering\\nthis response to Wittgenstein’s notorious last line: “But what we can’t say we\\ncan’t say, and we can’t whistle it either”.</p><p>Unlike the economists and rational choice theorists who would build on his work, Ramsey was not in pursuit of an ideal rationality. He did not think that we can understand decisions by studying mathematical models of conflict and co-operation between rational and self-interested choosers and he did not think that the best economy is one generated by the decisions of individuals, with minimal government intrusion. This will jar with the view that many economists have of Ramsey, for in his two economics papers, he seemed to produce classical and mathematically sophisticated utility calculations. But in his paper about savings, there was a clue about his true priorities – he insisted that the utilitarian argument for discounting the well-being of future generations (because some catastrophic event might wipe them out) was “ethically indefensible”. That is, an argument about ethics trumps the utility calculation. And in his famous paper on subjective utility theory, Ramsey was clear that keeping one’s degrees of belief consistent with the mathematics of probability is highly idealized and not suited for real-world policy making and economics. It “is too high a standard to expect of mortal men”. An ideal agent, having full or certain beliefs about every single thing, might always act in a way that he would expect to maximize utility. But people are far from ideal. Human fallibility and individual psychology are not mere frictions that interfere with the smooth working of decision-making. They are inextricable from the human condition. One can see the same anti-idealization impulse in Ramsey’s work on truth. In contrast to Moore, Russell, Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle, Ramsey’s approach, to use his own term, was “realistic”, as opposed to realist (that is: rejecting mystical and metaphysical so-called solutions to our deepest problems in favour of down-to-earth naturalist solutions). Indeed, in 1926, Ramsey started calling himself a pragmatist, which was almost a dirty word in Oxbridge at the time. His pragmatism consisted in characterizing the problem of truth as being largely a problem of human belief. Following the founder of American pragmatism, C. S. Peirce, Ramsey took a belief to be a habit of action or a rule with which we meet the future, evaluable in terms of whether or not it meets the future well. While he did not go all the way with Peirce and say that a true belief is one that we would agree on, were we to inquire as far as we fruitfully could on a matter, Ramsey thought there was something important in Peirce’s idea that the system which would best enable us to meet the future is true. </p><p>When Ramsey died, he was in the middle of writing a\\nbook in which he intended to develop a theory of truth that was both human and tied to the facts. This work is only\\nnow starting to be appreciated for its unified and powerful way of understanding\\nhow all sorts of beliefs are candidates for truth, including scientific and\\ncausal laws, inductive conclusions, counterfactual conditionals and ethical\\nbeliefs. None of these beliefs can be found in the boiled-down languages sought\\nby the realists. In the book draft, Ramsey illustrated the kind of approach he\\nwas taking with the following example:</p><p>To say a man believes in hell means, according to the pragmatists, that he avoids doing those things which would result in his being thrown into hell. </p><p>Such conduct will be useful to the man if it really saves him from hell, but if there is no such place it will be a mere waste of opportunities for enjoyment.</p><p>A belief is evaluated as true or false if it is\\nuseful or successful. But it is only useful if it is responsive to the way things are. That is Ramsey’s\\nattempt, in a nutshell, at combining the best of the correspondence theory of\\ntruth and the pragmatist theory of truth. The mistake the realist philosophers,\\nsuch as Wittgenstein and the logical positivists, made was to start with a\\npre-conceived notion of the way things are – one that rules out so much of what\\nis important to us. In the last year of his life, Ramsey said:</p><p>I used to worry myself about the nature of philosophy through excessive scholasticism. I could not see how we could understand a word and not be able to recognize whether a proposed definition of it was or was not correct. I did not realize the vagueness of the whole idea of understanding, the reference it involves to a multitude of performances any of which may fail and require to be restored. </p><p>Anyone familiar with the “later” Wittgenstein, with his focus on\\nmeaning as use and the multiplicity of our ordinary practices, will see that\\nthese ideas are clearly foreshadowed by Ramsey. It was Ramsey who was\\nresponsible for causing Wittgenstein in the 1930s to turn his back on the quest\\nfor certainty, purity and sparse metaphysical landscapes in the Tractatus and turn to ordinary language\\nand human practices – a kind of pragmatism, though Wittgenstein himself\\ndeclined to call it that (and Ramsey would not have liked Wittgenstein’s own\\nversion of pragmatism, in any case). </p><p>It was commonly thought that the realists of Ramsey’s day brooked no dissent. Robin Collingwood, at Oxford, certainly believed so. He, like Ramsey, was launching attacks on the “realism of Moore and the rest” in the late 1920s. In 1927, he bemoaned realism as being “the official philosophy of the day”, despite being “a very bad philosophy”. He wrote his intellectual autobiography largely to counter what he felt to be the marginalization of views opposed to realism. His own version of a human logic – a logic of question and answer – was scorned by his Oxford colleagues H. A. Pritchard and H. W. B. Joseph. Pritchard once growled at Collingwood: “I wish you’d get off the fence”.             </p><p>But in Cambridge, the young Frank Ramsey was also on the fence, trying to craft a position that respected both the subjectivity and objectivity involved in human inquiry. And he was also taking on the realism of “Moore and the rest”, to great effect. No doubt some of the respect he got was due to his technical brilliance. But a good measure of it was earned by the quality of his arguments both against that realism and for his own avowed pragmatism. </p><p>Wittgenstein, who wanted disciples, not critics, gave that respect only grudgingly. After Ramsey died, he said he had “an ugly mind”, was “a bourgeois thinker”, and only put forward “wearisome objections”. They had very different philosophical temperaments. Wittgenstein had argued in the Tractatus that philosophy cannot be done. It is literally nonsense, for it cannot be reduced to simple sentences that mirror objects in the world. The idea that philosophy, as we know it, is impossible survived in his later work, where he argued that philosophy is a kind of therapy aimed at curing one from asking philosophical questions. He counselled students not to do philosophy, but to do something worthwhile. And when those select few, such as Wittgenstein himself, engaged in philosophy, what they needed to do is “gnaw” at a problem, coming at it from many angles. Wittgenstein thought that “you can’t think decently if you don’t want to hurt yourself” – if you don’t want to suffer. This tendency was already present in the early Wittgenstein. Ramsey was unimpressed, calling Wittgenstein’s method “messing about”. Ramsey thought that philosophical problems could be solved, and went about solving a great number of them. He showed how to measure partial belief; he showed how we might think of counterfactual conditionals as true or false; he showed how we can talk about theoretical terms in science by employing an existentially quantified sentence containing only observational terms. Wittgenstein’s clear disagreement is reflected in those harsh words about Ramsey in the 1930s, while he himself was struggling to turn his back on the Tractatus. But later he paid Ramsey the most significant kind of compliment – he ditched the position Ramsey objected to and came round to something like Ramsey’s own. He thanked his old friend in the preface to the Philosophical Investigations:</p><p>since I began to occupy myself with philosophy again, sixteen years ago, I could not but recognize grave mistakes in what I set out in that first book. I was helped to realize these mistakes – to a degree which I myself am hardly able to estimate – by the criticism which my ideas encountered from Frank Ramsey, with whom I discussed them in innumerable conversations during the last two years of his life.</p><p>In the early twenties, F. P. Ramsey attended at least one course of my lectures. I had soon come to feel of him, as of Wittgenstein, that he was very much cleverer than I was, and consequently I felt distinctly nervous in lecturing before him: I was afraid that he would see some gross absurdity in things which I said, of which I was quite unconscious.</p><p>Russell, for his part, was happy with Ramsey’s assertion that “My\\npragmatism is derived from Mr. Russell \\n…  The essence of pragmatism I\\ntake to be this, that the meaning of a sentence is to be defined by reference\\nto the actions to which asserting it would lead, or, more vaguely still, by its\\npossible causes and effects”. Ramsey was referring to Russell’s 1921 The Analysis of Mind, which explored\\nthe idea that a belief is a disposition to behave. The realists were not so\\nbeastly, after all.</p><p>Ramsey’s untimely\\ndeath no doubt prompted searching questions about the meaning of life for his\\nfriends and family. But even on this subject, Ramsey left behind poignant\\ninsights. Indeed his remarks from 1925 on the problem of what it is to be human\\nremain as impactful as the dazzling achievements of his technical work:</p><p>My picture of the world is drawn in perspective, and not like a model to scale. The foreground is occupied by human beings and the stars are all as small as threepenny bits … I apply my perspective not merely to space but also to time. In time the world will cool and everything will die; but that is a long time off still, and its present value at compound discount is almost nothing. Nor is the present less valuable because the future will be blank. Humanity, which fills the foreground of my picture, I find interesting and on the whole admirable. I find, just now at least, the world a pleasant and exciting place. You may find it depressing; I am sorry for you, and you despise me. But [the world] is not in itself good or bad; it is just that it thrills me but depresses you. On the other hand, I pity you with reason, because it is pleasanter to be thrilled than to be depressed, and not merely pleasanter but better for all one’s activities.  </p><p>We should not focus on the vastness and the unknowability of the world, as Russell and Wittgenstein did, and to whom he was responding. Nor should we seek the meaning of life in a God, as did his brother Michael. Rather, we should direct our attention to what is admirable and conducive to good lives. We must find the meaning of life within our human, fallible, ways of being.</p><p>Cheryl Misak is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Toronto.

It’s the holiday that marks the Jewish new year. To celebrate, we eat apples and honey.</p><p>When is Rosh Hashanah? Rosh Hashanah 2020 begins at sundown Friday, September 18, and ends at sundown on Sunday, September 20.</p><p>What's it all about? Since the holiday is commonly called the “Jewish New Year,” one would think Rosh Hashanah would mark the first day of the first month of the Hebrew calendar. It doesn’t: Tishrei, on the first day of which we celebrate this major holiday, is the calendar’s seventh month. Why, then, is it given the distinction of marking the new year?</p><p>This question is especially vexing considering that—like the old adage about two Jews and twice as many opinions—the Hebrew calendar marks several different occasions as New Year’s Day: For example, the first day of Nissan, the first month, is the yardstick according to which we measure the years of the reign of kings, while if we were concerned with the tithing of animals, the date to keep in mind would have been the first of Elul, the sixth month.</p><p>Seven, however, had always had special meaning in Judaism; although Rosh Hashanah itself isn’t mentioned by name in the Bible, God, speaking to Moses in Leviticus 23:24, imagines the holiday as a sort of Sabbath for the soul: “On the first day of the seventh month,” says the Almighty, “you are to have a day of rest, a sacred assembly commemorated with trumpet blasts.”</p><p>These blasts come courtesy of the shofar, or ram’s horn, which is blown to awaken the congregation from its spiritual slumber and drive worshippers to repent. In the Mishna, the holiday is also referred to as “the day of judgment.” The world, the rabbis tell us, is assessed four times a year: on Passover, God passes judgment on the earth’s fertility for the coming year; on Shavuot, he judges the fruit of the trees, and on Sukkot, the rain. But on Rosh Hashanah, it’s man’s turn to stand trial.</p><p>Judaism being a legalistic religion, the procedure is described in detail. The Talmud, in the tractate on Rosh Hashanah, tells us that on that day God opens three celestial accounting books: in one He writes the names of the righteous, who will go on to live another year; and in the second, the names of the wicked, who shall perish from this earth before the year is over. The third, and most heavily populated, contains the names of those indeterminate souls whose fate hangs in the balance. They are then put on the heavenly waiting list, and have until Yom Kippur—the 10-day period known as Yamim Noraim (Days of Awe) or Asseret Yamei Teshuva (Ten Days of Repentance)—to repent for their past sins. And as we can never know for sure just which book has our name in it, goes the logic, best to join the atoners. The books, tradition has it, are sealed on Yom Kippur, which is why a common greeting in the period between the two holidays is le’shana tova tikatevu ve’tikhatemu—may your name be written and sealed for a good year.</p><p>Casting away sin, however, is serious business, so the custom of tashlikh was created, most likely in 13th-century Germany. The practice derives from the Book of Micah, which commands us in the penultimate verse of its last chapter, to cast all our sins “into the depths of the sea.” On the afternoon of the first day of Rosh Hashanah, Jews congregate by bodies of flowing water—usually rivers, seas, or, when necessary, faucets—toss in bits of bread and recite portions of Micah, and thereafter emerge cleansed and ready to repent.</p><p>What do we eat? You probably know all about the apples dipped in honey, which we eat to symbolize our wishes for a sweet new year. But did you know about the Rosh Hashanah seder? Though not celebrated as universally as the meal on Passover, it is nonetheless customary in many Jewish communities to hold a culinary ceremony on Rosh Hashanah’s first evening, chomping on myriad foods—from the head of a fish to leeks and gourds and black-eyed beans to pomegranates—and expounding on the symbolism of each one. The fish’s head, for example, represents our desire to be in the lead, and the pomegranate our wish to see our rights and good deeds become as plentiful as that fruit’s seeds. Some foods, however, are eaten because their names make for convenient puns in Hebrew or Aramaic: the carrot, for example, or gezer in Hebrew, is eaten to ward off gzerot, evil decrees, against the Jews. Then too, there is the challah. On Rosh Hashanah, the bread that appears year-round in its braided form is made on this holiday into a round, swirled shape, often enhanced with raisins. There are different reasons to explain the variation, among them that the circular shape has, like the world, no beginning and no end, or that the swirl looks like a crown, alluding to the head—or Rosh—of the year.</p><p>The larger question lurking behind the debate over “cancel culture” is the one about liberalism—to wit, what is liberalism, anyway? And why should we care about it? I signed the Harper’s “Letter on Justice and Open Debate” last month because it beams a clarifying spotlight on the cancel phenomenon, and on its progressive or left-wing version, in particular: “an intolerance of opposing views, a vogue for public shaming and ostracism, and the tendency to dissolve complex policy issues in a blinding moral certainty.” But I signed also because, in the course of making its point, the Harper’s letter scatters a few additional illuminations on the larger background question, as well. It is a nuanced letter. Its tone seems to me agreeably old school, recognizable from liberal debates and manifestos of long ago—which, to be sure, the letter’s detractors may regard as one more reason for dismissing the debate and the document and the signatories and their worries. But sometimes it is good to be reminded of times gone by.</p><p>Cancel culture is a new name, but the ideological coercions of an overheated left are not, after all, a new problem. They have a history, and, by my reckoning, they even have an origin, which goes back to the 1920s. The American Communist Party was founded in that period in the inebriating belief that Marxism in an updated Russian version was the last and irrefutable word in social science. And, bewitched by that idea, the Communists in New York and California and a few other places where their party was strong awarded themselves the right not just to harangue their rivals and opponents (which is everyone’s right), but to crush them, their left-wing rivals in particular, in the name of the human race.</p><p>They set about trying to impose their doctrine on the socialist or social democratic unions and on all the other organizations of the American left, on pain of destruction. Especially they tried to suppress anything unfavorable to the Soviet Union that was spoken from a lectern or printed in a book, which made for a very disagreeable campaign, typically on the edge of violence, or over the edge, with goon squads and boycotts, lasting throughout the 1920s and ’30s—a campaign with not much influence on a national scale, but quite a lot of it in Manhattan, the publishing center, and in a few other places, more than anyone seems to remember today (though you can read about it in the memoirs of Max Eastman, Sidney Hook, Irving Howe, and other writers).</p><p>Then again, the people who found themselves getting pushed around also have a history. The modern civil liberties and human rights movements got started in the same years as the Communist Party. And the activists in those movements and their friends among the intellectuals and especially in the unions put up a resistance—sometimes at a delay; sometimes undercut by episodes of gullible delusion about the Soviet Union, which was an intermittent oddity of the American Civil Liberties Union; and, then again, sometimes with a brutality of their own, which was pretty common in the unions.</p><p>But the resistance found its style, after a while. It was a firm resistance, which was also a nuanced resistance—a resistance that condemned the Communist coercions on principle, and, at the same time, was capable of acknowledging that, in spite of everything, the Communists in America sometimes played a helpful role on one specific issue or another. Nor did the resistance wish to see the government come in and smother the entire American left under a blanket repression. Nor did the resistance wish to ease up on the ancient struggle against the mobs and demagogues and coercions of the political right. Lucidity, balance, and persuasion were the idea.</p><p>In New York, the resistance to the Communist Party and its bullying tended, in the early years, to go under the names of “socialism” or “social democracy” or some other label of the radical left and the labor movement—though self-proclaimed liberals also played a role, not always as reliably as the socialists. But by the end of the 1930s, even the socialist intellectuals, some of them—even Sidney Hook, a principal figure in these battles, sword in hand—began to accept, maybe a little reluctantly, that “liberalism” was the appropriate term. Liberalism, the word and the concept, began to dominate the debate. And liberalism did prove to be persuasive.</p><p>Coercive impulses on the left (and on the right, which is its own story) are a hardy thing, though. You can read about them in Thucydides—in his account of revolutionaries in the city of Corcyra, where the democratic and anti-oligarchical fervors tilted into madness. And sooner or later the impulses go back into bloom. There was the case of the New Left in the 1960s and ’70s. The New Left in America got underway largely as a liberal movement. But somehow a Maoist inspiration took root here and there, together with a few inspirations from Fidel Castro and the Algerian revolution, until, by the end of the ’60s, a small and annoying percentage of the young New Leftists, irrigated by the hysterias of the era, responded by working up a mob brutality. And they set out to exact vengeance on the enemies of the human race, defined this time as the agents of imperialism, which meant, of course, the liberals. “Putschism” was Irving Howe’s left-wing phrase to describe the left-wing obnoxiousness. Or the New Left launched persecutions of New Leftism’s own erring heretics, who were practically everybody, after a while.</p><p>It was the old Stalinist crap in a new version, disorganized this time, instead of institutional, which made it hard to fend off. In the end, the crap was self-defeating. Even Maoists were human beings, and they could abide their own absurdities only for so long. But the challenge meanwhile for people who wanted to think of themselves as liberals was not a little bit perplexing. The liberals had to be firm, or, at least, not wobble too much, in the face of the New Left craziness. Then again, the liberals were sometimes distantly fond of the New Leftists, given the liberal origins. The liberals had to recognize that, even if New Leftism had taken a bad turn, it had meanwhile proved to be wonderfully productive in strengthening or revitalizing or even generating a bouquet of causes that are sometimes derided as “identity politics,” but that, even so, represented splendid new possibilities for a modern society. But was it possible to be anti-putsch and pro-innovation at the same time? To be firm, and also nuanced? It wasn’t easy. The worst of New Leftism had the good grace to disappear, and the best of its contributions continued.</p><p>And yet, post-New Left, something about the old coercive impulse still lingered on, if only in a version so odd as to be halfway comic. This became visible among a tiny number of people who, having been shaped by the identity-politics strands of the New Left insurrection, pursued conventional careers related to the arts, perhaps as academic literary scholars, or in the art galleries. These were not really political people, in the normal sense. Nor did they think of themselves as Communists in some updated version, except for a few, even if they did enjoy reading art magazines with Bolshevik names like October.</p><p>They fell under the influence, instead, of a series of avant-garde philosophical theories from France, which offered a novel combination of poetic meditations on language and anthropological observations on society—marvelous theories, designed to sprinkle a shimmery dust of the new on any topic that came to mind. In their American application, though, the marvelous theories were taken to be radical extensions of Marxism, capable of revealing the ultimate source of oppression. The ultimate source turned out to be the structures of language and word choice, combined with a universal will-to-power in the cause of social hierarchies of every kind.</p><p>Those were unusual ideas. Some people found in them a left-wing permission to escape from the rigidities of old-fashioned Marxism—a permission to explore, say, the cultural emphases of a modern feminism. But other people, having inhaled the new possibilities, lost themselves in an unspoken supposition that oppression, being linguistic in origins, is psychological in its results. They entertained the notion that, if you wish to know whether you are in the presence of the tyrannies of language structure and the will-to-power, you ought to consult your own injured feelings. And they launched mini-campaigns against anyone who wandered down the humanities department corridor using a vocabulary that might trigger bad feelings, or could be given a dangerously reactionary interpretation.</p><p>The campaigns were designed to humiliate the accused individuals or, in extreme cases, to damage their careers. There were not a lot of those campaigns. Still, the campaigns were disagreeable in the extreme to anyone who had to undergo them. Philip Roth captured the atmosphere in his 1990s college novel The Human Stain, about a professor who uses the wrong word. Eventually the campaigns subsided. Partly it was because Roth was not alone among the old-school liberals in saying, “Are you kidding?”</p><p>And the campaigns subsided because the avant-gardists themselves, some of them, began to acknowledge how over-the-top were the formulas about language and power. Or they began to notice how cruel and pointless were the humiliations—how reminiscent the humiliations were of the not-quite-forgotten Stalinist past. The phrase “politically correct,” which has ended up a right-wing insult, began, after all, as a left-wing insult. It was a rueful phrase, ironic and self-critical, which was lifted from the rhetoric of the Marxist past by reasonable people on the left for the purpose of ridiculing the unreasonable fanatics whose leftism was too much even for leftists to bear.</p><p>And yet, something about those campaigns, too, peculiar as they were, managed to linger on. It was a matter of viral mutation. The avant-garde philosophical reasoning of the 1970s and ’80s dropped away in favor of a more conventional English-language vocabulary (though with a continued insistence, in the spirit of linguistic determinism, on neologisms as the sign of social progress), which rendered the reformers’ zeal appealing to the dean’s office. And technology intervened. Roth’s novel takes place in the age of email, when a wrongly pressed “reply to all” button leads to disaster. But the age of social media is wilder.</p><p>A social media mob can do without the blessings of avant-garde theory. And yet, a few hints of advanced theory can make a mob appear to be respectably engaged in the praiseworthy policing of language infraction. Students, having spent their undergraduate years afloat in the atmosphere of the new ideas, found it natural to bring its inspirations into their own professional careers at the universities, or at the magazines and newspapers, and to yield to its impulse. This was the impulse to denounce and humiliate the perceived linguistic enemies of the anti-racist and anti-sexist cause. And the impulse flourished—such that, as Russell Jacoby says a little nervously on the first page of his new book, On Diversity, “To criticize diversity is to invite ostracism; you might as well climb on a desk and yell, ‘I am a racist and a fanatic!’”</p><p>It has added up to a vogue on the part of people who deem themselves to be diversity’s finest champions to ruin the careers of other people who may likewise be diversity’s champions, but whose zealotry is lacking, for the crime sometimes of choosing the wrong phrase, or the crime of clinging to a vocabulary judged to be outdated, or, in the case of editors, the crime of publishing even a single disapproved article or composing a wrong headline. The results do not amount to Stalin’s Great Terror, redux. They amount to Roth’s novel, expanded. Or they are something out of Hawthorne, who recalled the Calvinism-gone-mad of the 17th century, or out of Arthur Miller’s The Crucible, which, in pretending to recall what Hawthorne recalled, conjured the hysterias of McCarthyism.</p><p>In the precincts where the vogue for those persecutions flourishes, everyone does see it. Everyone notices the creepily uniform adaptation of certain new and pointless phrases (i.e., “enslavers” instead of “slave owners”) in the magazines and some of the newspapers, and a certain piety in the philanthropic and arts foundations, and a tiptoeing around certain issues, e.g., the doctrines of the Islamist movement. Everyone with a range of acquaintances in the universities hears the stories of professors in one school or another who are frightened for their own careers—serious scholars who are reluctant to discuss ideas with their students, and are reluctant to assign the classics of literature, and are reluctant to broach certain political controversies or even to exhibit posters, for fear of meeting the enraged militants of correctness and getting hauled into the courtrooms of Salem, where Title IX investigations take place.</p><p>These stories may seem exaggerated if you take them to mean that every school in the country has fallen under a shadow, and every last professor dwells in fear, which is not the case. And yet, some incidents are beyond exaggerating. Here, for instance, are roughly 350 professors at Princeton just now who have affixed their signatures to a letter addressed to the president and officers of their very fine university calling for, among other measures, a special committee to “oversee the investigation and discipline of racist behaviors, incidents, research, and publication on the part of faculty”—which is amazing to see, even if some of the professors have told Conor Friedersdorf at the Atlantic that, in signing the letter, they never meant to endorse its most salient provision, which is the call for the special committee. They signed, though. It is hard to believe. Then again, it is easy to believe. Irving Howe, in his A Margin of Hope, described the university professors of the 1930s who fell under a Stalinist influence: “At least as troubling was the need felt by serious people for a ritual abandonment of intellectual independence—indeed, for a ritual abasement before the brutalities of power.”</p><p>The little circle of writers who composed the Harper’s letter last month—Thomas Chatterton Williams, Mark Lilla, David Greenberg, George Packer, and Robert F. Worth—are merely a group of friends, variously literary, academic, and journalistic. They do not control a magazine or command a budget, and they do not come from similar philosophical backgrounds, which means they lack even the vague power that emanates from being a clique. But, having written their statement, they appear to have had no trouble at all in obtaining the signatures of 153 people, some of them rather well known (the world’s leading children’s novelist, the world’s most famous trumpeter, not to mention Noam Chomsky!), without even having bothered to round up, in addition, some of the writers who have preceded them in blowing a bugle on these issues.</p><p>The letter is only three paragraphs, but, even so, it has turned into a topic of conversation on a world scale, not just in the English language. Mario Vargas Llosa (the world’s leading non-children’s novelist, arguably) and a hundred cultural and scientific figures in the Spanish-speaking world have produced their own letter in support of the Harper’s letter and in condemnation of la cancelación and el linchamiento—two contributions by the United States, sad to say, to the global vocabulary of tyrannical behaviors.</p><p>And yet, when I say that everyone sees the problem, what I actually mean is that everyone ought to see it. To cite the example most in view lately, everyone ought to see something troubling about the firing of James Bennet, the New York Times op-ed editor. Bennet’s error was to do what op-ed editors at the Times have always done, which is to publish op-eds now and then by Attila the Hun, meaning in this case Sen. Tom Cotton from Arkansas, whose contribution was titled, of course, “Send in the Troops.” Wrote Attila: “Nihilist criminals are simply out for loot.” The value in publishing this sort of thing has always been, in the past, to allow the readers to see the actual words unmediated, which is distinctly useful, and to bow symbolically in the direction of open debate, though without necessarily suggesting that Attila is a worthy debate partner. And the value has been to show the world that even Attila recognizes the universal status of The New York Times. To publish Attila has always been a power move, at the Times.</p><p>In the present atmosphere, though, the editor was deemed by a large number of his indignant colleagues not just to have made a mistake, but to have committed a career-ending crime—which, because the Times is, in fact, the universal newspaper, can only mean that executives everywhere in the world of liberal institutions had better find ways not to offend the enraged militants. Here is el linchamiento: a lynching intended as a message to the world. The lynching is an obvious outrage to the traditional liberalism of the Times itself. And yet, many people plainly do not see an outrage. Nor do they see an intimidation of other journalists or professors. Nor do they see a curious ritual self-abasement by The New York Times, nor any problem at all. They see social progress.</p><p>This has been one of the revelations produced by the Harper’s letter—the indignant response of people who, in not seeing any of the troubling developments, earnestly believe that accusations of anything suggesting ideological coercions on the left add up to a right-wing slander. A lengthy manifesto bearing the signatures of more than 160 journalists and academics—“A More Specific Letter on Justice and Open Debate”—makes the argument that the Harper’s letter represents a systematic hypocrisy, designed to conceal the stifling of oppressed voices.</p><p>But then, as various commentators have noticed, still another virtue of the Harper’s letter has been to provoke responses that confirm the diagnosis. I notice an op-ed by Pankaj Mishra at Bloomberg News under the title, “No, Cancel Culture Isn’t a Threat to Civilization” (nor are straw men a worthy rhetorical tool), which associates the Harper’s signatories with Donald Trump (whom the signatories explicitly deplore). And the op-ed concludes by regretting, with a wistful glance at the glistening blade, that various of the signatories, myself included, have not yet paid for their ideological crimes by having their careers severed at the neck (though no sooner did Mishra’s regret appear in print than Bari Weiss, one of the signatories, felt it necessary to give up her own career at what used to be Bennet’s section of The New York Times—Bari Weiss, whose commentary on the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre of 2018 is one of the most emotionally powerful condemnations of the violence of right-wing bigotry to have appeared in the Times or anywhere else in the press during the last several years).</p><p>So the Harper’s letter has proved to be a fine example of a self-verifying manifesto. It points out a problem, and, by attracting a response, demonstrates the reality of what it points out.</p><p>But the deeper virtue of the letter, as I say, is to scatter a few light beams on the liberal idea. One of those beams illuminates a central mystery of these several controversies. This is the question of where to draw the line between liberalism and various doctrines and impulses that claim to stand further to the left—a murky question because a series of popular conceptions insist on drawing the line in every place except the right place.</p><p>It is sometimes thought, for instance, that any line between liberalism and a more radical left should be more of a smudge, without sharp definition. Liberalism and a more radical left should be recognized as pretty much the same, except that liberalism is more pragmatic, or perhaps less imaginative. Or liberalism is more polite, or more upper class, or cowardly. But finally liberalism and the more radical left agree on their progressive social goals. Or it is thought that liberalism is not actually the same as a more radical leftism, but is, instead, an enemy of social progress, which hides behind a cloud of respectable-sounding and meaningless words. Liberalism is a right-wing backlash, disguised as a left-wing forward leap. Liberalism is an imperialist plot.</p><p>Or it is thought that liberal idealism is a fraud, and that something like the Harper’s letter, which pretends to make a high-minded plea for open debate, is merely a maneuver designed to protect the elite privileges of the signatories, who are deemed to be, of course, wealthy whites (Ralph W. Ellison looks up from his writing desk, fascinated), determined on facing down democracy in action. But those are mistakes.</p><p>Liberalism is not, in fact, the same as a more radical leftism, given a few tactical divergences. Nor is liberalism a cloak for right-wing reaction. Nor is liberalism a centrism. Liberalism, properly understood, is its own tendency of thought. It upholds its own concerns. The first of those concerns is not even political. It is a commitment to a particular state of mind—to the mental composure that lends itself to rational thought and a playful imagination. And liberalism is a commitment to ensuring the political and social conditions that favor a mental composure of that sort.</p><p>It makes those commitments in the belief that rational thought and a playful imagination are desirable in themselves, and in the belief that a large part of everything else that is desirable in society depends on their prosperity. The Harper’s letter does not describe itself as liberal—and, to be sure, some of the signatories might prefer some other label, or no label at all, and certainly no label that a random commentator like me might propose. But I attach the “liberal” label to the letter, even so, because its principal concern is “open debate,” which means the kind of intellectual freedom that I am describing.</p><p>Then again, liberalism in the United States has idiosyncrasies all its own, and the Harper’s letter is a decidedly American document, even if it bears the signatures of people from other shores, as well. The hostility to the coercions of the American Communist Party that I have described from the 1920s and ’30s was a left-wing affair. And the liberal tradition in America during the next 90 years has tended to be dominated by people who have likewise stood in some fashion, vaguely or overtly, on the political left—people whose instinct has been to side at least in a general way with the various and sometimes contradictory grand causes of the last hundred years that comport with an idea of democratic progress.</p><p>The liberal tradition in America, seen in this light, has always been a tradition in favor of a double struggle—a struggle for a freer intellect and, at the same time, a struggle for democratic progress. The philosopher John Dewey used to loom as the master thinker of the liberal intellectuals in America, and his great inspiration was to work up the double idea into a philosophical system—a way of seeing the struggles for intellectual insight and the struggles for democratic emancipation as phases of the same development, which was a wonderfully 19th-century notion, with a provenance in Whitman, and in Hegel.</p><p>The Harper’s “Letter on Justice and Open Debate” hits the double-struggle note even in its title. The letter acknowledges with approval the “powerful protests for racial and social justice.” It approves the “wider calls for greater equality and inclusion across our society, not least in higher education, journalism, philanthropy, and the arts”—which is to say, it approves the calls for social reform in the very corners of society that are inhabited by the signatories. And the letter insists that, in condemning what it calls “illiberalism,” it stands with the social protests, and not against them. “The democratic inclusion we want can be achieved only if we speak out against the intolerant climate that has set in on all sides.” “We refuse any false choice between justice and freedom, which cannot exist without each other.”</p><p>Only, here is a point of difference between the people who may think of themselves principally as liberals, and the people who think of themselves as standing further to the left. The characteristic mark of the more radical left does not consist of any particular program for politics or economics. It consists, instead, of a certain kind of indignation, sometimes a glorious indignation, sometimes a problematic one, but which, in either case, rests on a belief about justice and injustice. This is the belief that injustice is ultimately a single thing, which means that justice, too, is ultimately a single thing. And it is the belief that radical leftism’s thrilling achievement is to have identified the terrible single thing that is injustice.</p><p>The name of that single injustice has varied over the years. To the Communists in the 1920s and ’30s, its name was capitalism, whose ultimate injustice was hostility to the Soviet Union. To the New Leftists who fell under some kind of Maoist or Third Worldist influence in the later 1960s and ’70s, the name was imperialism. To the humanities department avant-gardists of the 1980s and ’90s, the name of the single injustice was (in various versions) the structures of language in the service of racial and gender hierarchies, as conjured by an Americanized reading of sundry philosophers of the French avant-garde. To the aroused progressives of our own moment, the name of the single terrible thing is racism, or rather, the universal bigotry that is expressed by the word “intersectionalism”—the bigotry that takes a thousand forms, each of which intersects with all of the others, thereby making a mathematical whole. But finally the different names are the same. They are names of the omni-oppression, which, under whatever name, crushes its victims.</p><p>Liberalism, though—liberalism in the peculiar American style, which worries not just about “open debate” but about “justice”—does not share the idea about a single terrible thing. Liberalism may worry about economic exploitations, or imperialism, or racial and gender hierarchies, or any number of oppressions. But it does not assume that all oppressions figure within an omni-oppression. Liberalism is anti-intersectionalist. It does not believe that every oppression is comparable in some mathematical fashion to every other oppression. Liberalism believes in the many, instead of the one—to borrow a phrase from Michael Walzer, whose signature appears on the Harper’s letter.</p><p>And so it is in the “Letter on Justice and Open Debate.” The letter speaks out against the illiberalism of Donald Trump and, without naming them, the other populist demagogues of our moment. It speaks out against the injustices that have rightly brought millions of people into the streets during these last months, which are the injustices of American racism. But it speaks out also against the very different oppression that is liberalism’s unique calling to denounce, which is the censorious pressure on writers and thinkers and artists to conform. And it chooses to speak about the censoriousness even if, by citing objectionable realities that come from the left and right alike, it presents the awkward spectacle of a social analysis that points its accusatory finger in more than one direction.</p><p>The Harper’s letter casts one other light on liberalism—or, at least, in my interpretation it does. And, since I have been going on about the 1920s and ’30s, I will describe the further aspect by citing a precedent from those times. This was an incident in the American history of mass-signature intellectual manifestos, dating from the spring and summer of 1939—terrifying months, perhaps not unlike the months that we ourselves have been living through.</p><p>John Dewey was 80 years old in 1939, and Sidney Hook, more than 40 years younger, was Dewey’s most vigorous disciple. The two of them and a little circle of friends put together a committee, with Dewey as chairman, Hook as organizer, and the journalist Eugene Lyons as prose-improver, to compose a “Statement of Principles” and solicit signatures. In May 1939, they published their statement in The Nation. The best account of it appears in Hook’s memoirs, Out of Step, from 1987. The statement addressed an issue that was not otherwise generating a lot of attention in the United States. This was the vocation of thinking independently and creatively. And the statement addressed the state of freedom around the world that allows for that kind of thinking, and that allows for independent and creative thinkers to express their thoughts. The statement said, all too accurately: “Never before in modern times has the integrity of the writer, the artist, the scientist and the scholar been threatened so seriously.”</p><p>The threat to the integrity of writers, artists, scientists, and scholars came from what Dewey and Hook and their committee described as the “totalitarian idea” and its “unvarying hatred for the free mind.” The unvarying hatred produced “artistic sterility, an enslaved intellectual life, a tragic caricature of culture.” Dewey and Hook and the committee saw a danger of this sort in America. “Even in the United States, its beginnings are all too evident—in the emergence of local political dictators, the violation of civil rights, the alarming spread of phobias of hatred directed against racial, religious, and political minorities.”</p><p>I am not sure which local dictators they had in mind. Were they afraid of Mayor Frank Hague of Jersey City, a notorious despot, doubly powerful because he was allied with Franklin D. Roosevelt? Were they worried about the populist legacy of Huey Long in Louisiana? Father Coughlin, the fascist radio priest—the first of the right-wing radio blowhards—must have frightened them. But it is obvious what they had in mind in speaking about phobias of hatred. Anti-Semitism was at high tide in the American 1930s, and the Ku Klux Klan was a prestigious national movement.</p><p>But mostly the threat was in other parts of the world—in “Germany, Italy, Russia, Japan, and Spain.” In those countries, “intellectual and creative independence is suppressed and punished as a form of treason.” The victims in their thousands had been “silenced, imprisoned, tortured, or hounded into exile.” And, from there, the threat, in spreading to still other places, was producing a panic among writers and thinkers around the world, who, in fear or despair, “hasten to exalt one brand of intellectual servitude over another,” and seek to make “fine distinctions between various methods of humiliating the human spirit.”</p><p>The “Statement of Principles” was an historic manifesto. It was the first time that American intellectuals had stood for intellectual freedom on a global scale, in every continent. It attracted an impressive set of 142 signatories. Philosophers, most importantly: not just Dewey and Hook but Rudolf Carnap, the Vienna Circle positivist in his American exile, and Arthur O. Lovejoy and others. A series of novelists: John Dos Passos, Sherwood Anderson, Edna Ferber, George S. Schuyler, and others. Poets: Babette Deutsch, Countee Cullen. Max Ernst, the lead lawyer at the ACLU, was a signatory. Economists: Abram Harris. Norman Thomas, the Socialist, signed, and so did Carlo Tresca, the anarcho-syndicalist. The painter John Sloan. The historians Carl Becker, Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr., Merle Curti. Judged by the standards of that time, but described in the language of today, the signatories amounted to a notably “diverse” group, too, as some readers may notice from the names I have just mentioned.</p><p>But it was also a controversial manifesto. Everybody could see that, in making its call for intellectual freedom, it was an anti-Nazi and anti-fascist manifesto. But it included Russia in the list of countries that had fallen under totalitarian rule. And it made clear that, in warning about the brands of intellectual servitude, or the methods of humiliating the human spirit, it had in mind the ruling doctrines, different as they were, of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, Fascist Spain, imperial Japan—and Russia alike, which meant Soviet Marxism.</p><p>A second group of people therefore put together a counter-manifesto. The second group was a “Committee of 400,” and their counter-manifesto was addressed “To All Active Supporters of Democracy and Peace.” The counter-manifesto denounced the “Statement of Principles” for having included Russia in the list of totalitarian countries. And the Committee of 400 denounced the signatories of the “Statement of Principles” as “fascists and their friends.” The counter-manifesto, too, ran in The Nation, with the signatures of less than 400 people, but, even so, some distinguished names: Dashiell Hammett, James Thurber, I.F. Stone, the young Richard Wright.</p><p>And barely had the counter-manifesto appeared than Hitler and Stalin announced their military alliance, which made the Committee of 400 look ridiculous. Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia were, in fact, brothers, or, at least, cousins. Far from identical, but with the same jut in the chin. The persecution of writers and thinkers and artists in one country did, in fact, resemble the persecution in the other country—resemble, that is, by being total. The alliance of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union was not even a surprise—not to the circles around Dewey.</p><p>But I tell this story to make a different point. Analytically speaking, the difference between the one manifesto and the other turned on the question of injustice. The Dewey-and-Hook “Statement of Principles” hazarded the idea that injustice might come from multiple directions—from the extreme right, but also from the extreme left. The Committee of 400 entertained no such possibility. Injustice, in the view of the 400, came only from the right. And if you insisted on saying that it might also come from the left—well, you were a “fascist or a friend of fascists.” Which is to say: Given the opportunity, you should be, as it were, “canceled.”</p><p>Here, I think, was the difference between liberalism and the more radical left—the expansive American liberalism of those days that had room for socialists and anarcho-syndicalists and other leftists, but was, even so, a liberalism, with its belief that injustice is multiple; and the more radical left that could not abide the idea of multiple sources of injustice. Here was something further, too. Here, in the Dewey-and-Hook “Statement of Principles,” was a liberal mobilization determined on drawing the line between liberalism and the non-liberalism of the left.</p><p>For what is liberalism, finally? It is not a political party, and not a faction. Liberalism is a temper of mind, a set of ideas, perhaps a sense of tradition. And yet, sometimes liberalism does pull itself together to become a force, if only in the shape of informal little committees that mobilize for the purpose of recognizing that a first principle does exist. This is the principle of independent and creative thought, which ought to be the vocation of writers and scholars and artists, and in some degree ought to be within reach of everyone in a democratic society. It is a principle that can prosper only in the healthy zones of social and political freedom—a principle that, in our own day, is not even remotely at death’s door, as it was in 1939, knock on wood, but is, even so, under a pressure, however modest the pressure may appear to be. And pressure requires resistance.</p><p>Paul Berman is Tablet’s critic-at-large.

His robust presence, which commanded any room back then, was incompatible with the idea of his shrinking into doddering frailty. But Brodsky was both young and old. His energy, his probing mind, the rakish slant of his shoulders, his reach-for-the-rafters poetry readings—these qualities kept him ever clothed in the semblance of youth, a boy genius in secondhand jackets that looked as if they came off the rack wrinkled and ink stained, yet draping him like a monument. But he also seemed old. Watching him chain-smoke Kent III cigarettes, having first bitten off the filter, despite two bypass surgeries, made his death from a heart attack in 1996 at age 55 seem a terminus already ticketed. And long before ill health carved a certain tiredness around the eyes, he exuded the aura of someone who had lived more deeply than most, been through much more. His slate-blue peepers looked not only across rooms, but centuries.</p><p>This gaze suggests the mien behind his poetry. Even when they first appeared, Brodsky’s poems spoke to the moment, but also through it. At the conclusion of “Eclogue IV: Winter,” translated from the Russian by himself, he captures the passing feel of writing on a page while also making the case for its permanence:</p><p>Cyrillic, while running witless\\non the pad as though to escape the captor,\\nknows more of the future than the famous sibyl:\\nof how to darken against the whiteness,\\nas long as the whiteness lasts. And after.</p><p>The urge to consciously speak across time, coupled with Brodsky’s ability to inject his own speaking presence into the poems, accounts for their high degree of self-reflexivity. As he writes in “A Part of Speech,” the poem that more than any other placed him on the world stage, “What gets left of a man amounts / to a part. To his spoken part. To a part of speech.” Throughout his poems he makes constant reference to the fleeting and visceral act of speech itself, so much so that it is often hard to know where the man stops and the poem begins. Because Brodsky seems to be talking out loud in his poems, they can feel more recorded than written, no matter their loyalty to rhyme and meter. His friend and fellow Nobel laureate Derek Walcott shared his fondness for allusions to the pen crossing the page, but for Brodsky, the poem becomes a theater in which he commands center stage, drawing the reader in not just as a reader but also as a spectator at a drama.</p><p>As with Walt Whitman, Brodsky’s persona fuels the engine of his poems. The difference is that whereas Whitman wished to infuse a single individual with a collective consciousness, Brodsky was bent on describing, free of cant or self-justification, not only what it means to be a human being but also what it means to be this human being. Persecuted and interrogated by the Soviets, twice thrown into mental institutions, and finally denounced and sentenced in 1964 to five years’ hard labor in the Arctic (though released after 18 months), he’d already had quite the life before he was “invited” to leave Russia for good in 1972. As his mentor Anna Akhmatova quipped, “What a biography they’re fashioning for our red-haired friend!” Though the psychological and physical toll was no doubt staggering, he rarely spoke of it. But what had happened to this human being was enough to destroy almost anyone.</p><p>I met him in 1981, when I took his poetry seminar in the graduate writing program at Columbia, but really it was years before that I had dipped into his Selected Poems of 1973, and then most pointedly into A Part of Speech when it was published in 1980. The opening of the latter’s title poem still rests in my ear to this day in George L. Kline’s translation:</p><p>I was born and grew up in the Baltic marshland\\nby zinc-gray breakers that always marched on\\nin twos. Hence all rhymes, hence that wan flat voice\\nthat ripples between them like hair still moist,\\nif it ripples at all.</p><p>Just months out of college, reading this at night after spending my days building stone walls in a terraced garden in Wales, I felt transported. Here was a poet who in only a few lines could wed nature, birth, rhymes, and the speaking voice, all of it laced with a melancholy born of the lament laid down in Kline’s translation of “Odysseus to Telemachus”:</p><p>Telemachus, my son!\\nTo a wanderer the faces of all islands\\nresemble one another. And the mind\\ntrips, numbering waves; eyes, sore from sea horizons,\\nrun; and the flesh of water stuffs the ears.\\nI can’t remember how the war came out;\\nEven how old you are—I can’t remember.</p><p>Given that I was the son of a truck driver and the sole sibling or cousin to earn a BA degree, and that I wrote poems, had traveled in Europe, and had no prospects of a job or career, it might be tempting to read something Oedipal into my response. But I was not out to slay the father, or even to deny my own, whom I loved dearly. Rather, I felt the desire to become a different kind of son, to serve something larger, something older. A few months later, I turned in my mason’s trowel for a plane ticket, headed home, and applied to Columbia.</p><p>There, in what can only be described as the Soviet glumness of Dodge Hall, Brodsky would hold forth for two hours each Tuesday. Hardy, Frost, Cavafy, and Auden were the main fare, as well as Wilfred Owen, Osip Mandelstam, and Marina Tsvetaeva. Brodsky was not the most elegant of classroom managers, to say the least. His method mainly consisted of asking a question for which he clearly had the answer, and then proceeding to quietly reply to any student response with either “Garbage” or “Pretty good.” (I once received a “Pretty good—in fact, that’s awfully good!” at which point it felt as if the heavens would burst into chorus.) Described this way, Brodsky’s method sounds like a nightmare, and I’m sure for some it was, but for many of us the performance was mesmerizing.</p><p>From three to five P.M. on those darkening fall afternoons, we felt that we were not so much in the presence of a poet, and certainly not an academic or a scholar, as of poetry itself. Nothing of this man’s thinking was held back, and it seemed as if he were making his case for poetry to the spheres rather than to a roomful of graduate students. Yes, he could be rude, and no, none of us ever got our essays back with any kind of useful comments, if we got them back at all. And he could be wrongheaded (his case for reading Frost’s “Home Burial” as a tragic rendering of Pygmalion’s love for Galatea seemed a stretch) or even flat wrong (Brecht and Neruda are not second-rate poets—they were just Marxists; Nabokov is not a “failed poet,” just a fellow genius of a different stripe). But once you found your way past the manner, you got to the matter: a whole and almost molecular engagement with what poetry can be, why it matters, and why it is the very manna of thought and feeling when read seriously.</p><p>This kind of gravitas remains the central attraction of Brodsky’s verse. He pegged poetry as “the supreme form of human locution in any culture,” representing “not even a form of art, but our anthropological, genetic goal, our linguistic, evolutionary beacon” (from his essay “An Immodest Proposal”). Although these ideals might seem too lofty for the marginalized art of poetry to bear up under today, they were at the core of what he felt to be his charge as a teacher. Agree with him or not on any particular poet or poem, there was no ignoring what he handed over freely to his class, and what he cites elsewhere in the same essay, namely, that poetry “is the only insurance available against the vulgarity of the human heart.” Reading poetry, “you become what you read, you become the state of the language which is a poem, and its epiphany or its revelation is yours,” and the same could be said for his teaching.</p><p>Revelation is what his poems still offer. This seductive quality helped seal Brodsky’s standing in the 1980s, especially after the publication of A Part of Speech. In “Lullaby of Cape Cod,” one of his best poems, beautifully rendered in English by Anthony Hecht, Brodsky’s voice is front and center when he observes, “The change of Empires is intimately tied / to the hum of words, the soft, fricative spray / of spittle in the act of speech.” A few lines later, however, a shift occurs from the act of speech to the poet’s own immediate bodily presence:</p><p>In general, of all our organs the eye\\nalone retains its elasticity,\\npliant, adaptive as a dream or wish.\\nFor the change of Empires is linked with far-flung sight,\\nwith the long gaze across the ocean’s tide\\n(somewhere within us lives a dormant fish),\\nand the mirror’s revelation that the part in your hair\\nthat you meticulously placed on the left side\\nmysteriously shows up on the right,</p><p>linked to weak gums, to heartburn brought about\\nby a diet unfamiliar and alien,\\nto the intense blankness, to the pristine white\\nof the mind, which corresponds to the plain, small\\nblank page of letter paper on which you write.</p><p>Notice how he moves from the eye to the mirror, to the part in the hair, to the gums, heart, mind, and finally, and pointedly, to the blank page on which he writes, perhaps, the lines we are reading. A couple of pages later in this long, marvelous poem, this implied inner voyeurism turns into the full-fledged assertion of the poet speaking and writing in unison:</p><p>I write these words out blindly, the scrivening hand\\nattempting to outstrip\\nby a second the “How come?”\\nthat at any moment might escape the lip,\\nthe same lip of the writer,\\nand sail away into night, there to expand\\nby geometrical progress, und so weiter.</p><p>If this were not enough to allow the reader to inhabit the poet sitting at his desk, the poem hands itself off to the reader more and more as it progresses, especially when Brodsky asks us to</p><p>Preserve these words against a time of cold,\\na day of fear: man survives like a fish,\\nstranded, beached, but intent\\non adapting itself to some deep, cellular wish,\\nwriggling toward bushes, forming hinged leg-struts, then\\nto depart (leaving a track like the scrawl of a pen)\\nfor the interior, the heart of the continent.</p><p>The poem, having traced the evolution of the poet’s speech in attaining landfall through “the scrawl of a pen,” invokes our own evolution as well. The illusion is that we are no longer just readers of the poem, but rather a part of the poem, Brodsky’s inner monologue and thoughts played out as if our very own voice were speaking to ourselves. Indeed, “Lullaby of Cape Cod” may essentially be about a poet talking to himself inside a room, but what a room it is. If its 412 lines were not enough to demand our total immersion, its journey into and through the void epitomizes what Brodsky felt was the core strength of American poetry as set down by Frost in “A Servant to Servants,” namely, that “the best way out is always through” (quoted in Brodsky’s essay “Speech at the Stadium” and elsewhere). The poem shows him not only at the height of his powers but also having conquered the dire circumstances of exile, grief, and loss that would have derailed most other people.</p><p>This drive carried over to the classroom. As one cold December day faded into night outside Dodge Hall, he got to the end of two hours on Frost and said to the class, “I need another hour, who can stay?” Half my classmates reached for their coats and knapsacks, but the rest of us settled in. What followed, however, was not a class but an hour-long monologue, Brodsky’s brow breaking into sweat as he dragged hard on those Kent IIIs and conversed with the back of tomorrow. Much of what he said can be found in the title essay of his 1995 collection On Grief and Reason. That essay focuses exclusively on “Home Burial” and Brodsky’s insistence that</p><p>This is a poem about language’s terrifying success, for language, in the final analysis, is alien to the sentiments it articulates. No one is more aware of that than a poet; and if “Home Burial” is autobiographical, it is so in the first place by revealing Frost’s grasp of the collision between his métier and his emotions.</p><p>Quite the reading of Frost, one might say, but the credibility of it in relation to Frost is not the point. Instead, it is Brodsky’s reading of Frost, and not just of him, but of poetry itself, one forged with a passion and a laser-like gaze that cuts away the fat in order to get right down to what Brodsky saw as the poem’s muscle.</p><p>He did this with a number of Frost’s poems on that night until, exhausted, as if at last freed of all he had to say on the matter, he stopped. Taking a sip of coffee, he scanned the dozen or so faces still in the room before beginning with the “Vwell, vwell, vwell …” he so frequently used as a stopgap in which to load up his next thought. In this case: “Some of you will go on to become poets, though many of you will not, for that’s just what comes to pass and what statistics tell us. But there is one thing that all of you must do and that is be grateful for this language!” His eyes glistening, his hand resting on the collected Frost as if it were a Bible, that was it, the clear implication being that we should be grateful for Frost and for the English language itself.</p><p>As elementary a lesson as that may sound, it is rare to have it delivered so directly and with such passion, as well as for it to be allowed to hover in the air at the end of three hours. Brodsky’s flair for the dramatic was a pedagogical tool, for his thinking on poetry and much else was so singular, so surprising, and at times so strange that there was never a conversation to be had with him in which I didn’t learn something, nor did I have to agree with that something in order to learn, because what he set in motion above all else was thought itself. Not the limits of a meager idea, but the activity of thought itself. And that was what was so freeing, why there was more oxygen in the room when Brodsky was in it, and what I kept returning to in the years to come.</p><p>That same night after his aria on Frost, as we walked out of Dodge Hall, I had the audacity to ask if he might want to go for a drink. “Let’s try it!” he offered, and before I knew it, I was sitting at a table in a bar across the street, waiting for Brodsky to collect our drinks and wondering, what the hell am I going to say now? Wisely, I started with the only thing I could think of: “What should I read?”</p><p>Nodding his head in approval, he asked for pen and paper, and there in a little notebook I carried around he scribbled down a list: Edwin Arlington Robinson, Weldon Kees (underlined), Ovid, Horace, Virgil, Catullus, minor Alexandrian poets, Paul Celan, Peter Huchel, Georg Trakl (underlined), Antonio Machado, Umberto Saba, Eugenio Montale (underlined), Andrew Marvell, Ivor Gurney, Patrick Kavanagh, Douglas Dunne, Zbigniew Herbert (underlined), Vasco Popa, Vladimir Holan, Ingeborg Bachmann, “Gilgamesh,” Randall Jarrell, Vachel Lindsay, Theodore Roethke, Edgar Lee Masters, Howard Nemerov, Max Jacob, Thomas Trahern, and then a short list of essayists: Hannah Arendt, William Hazlitt, George Orwell, Elias Canetti (underlined and Crowds and Power added), E. M. Cioran (Temptation to Exist added), and finally the poet Les Murray added in my own hand after he suggested it. The sheet of paper, roughly the size of an iPhone but, as Brodsky would say, with far more and far greater information stored within it, remains tucked away inside my copy of A Part of Speech to this day.</p><p>What else we talked about I cannot remember, but a friendship had blossomed. The following year several fellow students approached me to ask if I might inquire whether Brodsky would be willing to do a tutorial on Russian poetry with us. Not only did he agree, but he insisted that we come to his Greenwich Village apartment on Morton Street each Sunday night, where he handed out mimeographs of translations of 19th-century Russian poets—V. A. Zhukovsky, E. A. Baratynsky, F. I. Tyutchev, Pushkin, and others—which later turned into An Age Ago, the anthology translated by Alan Myers with an introduction by Brodsky. In it he writes,</p><p>[A]n age ago, much less stood between man and his thoughts about himself than today. … That is, he knew practically as much as we do about the natural and social sciences; however, he had not yet fallen victim to this knowledge. He stood, as it were, on the very threshold of that captivity, largely unaware of the impending danger, apprehensive perhaps, but free. Therefore, what he can tell us about himself, about the circumstances of his soul or mind, is of historical value in the sense that history is always free people’s monologue to slaves.</p><p>Sunday nights at Joseph’s house, indeed! You didn’t ask that many questions, you just wrote in a notebook as fast as you could. And how freeing it all was, and how welcome we felt in that low-ceilinged bungalow, Brodsky archly muttering “Horses, horses!” to the rumbling gallop of the espresso pot as it boiled on the stove.</p><p>Graduation and a Fulbright to translate Ingeborg Bachmann’s poems (ah, that list of poets he wrote down and its trajectory) took me to Vienna for the next two years, but never quite far from Brodsky. One day a package arrived with a copy of the latest Vanity Fair, which contained his splendid essay on Auden, “A Passion of Poets,” which he wanted me to deliver to a descendant of Prince Razumovsky (of Beethoven quartets fame), who had been kind to him on his landing there in June 1972. A couple of months later another item came, from a friend of mine and wrapped as a gift. Titled J.B.–Debut, it is a chapbook containing eight poems translated by Carl R. Proffer and published by Ardis, the Russian-language publishing house he helped found. The copyright page dates it as a limited edition published in 1973 in “twenty-six copies lettered A to Z and twenty copies numbered from 1 to 20, each signed by the author.” The warm wonder of it, as a gift from a friend who knew what Brodsky meant to me, could be matched only by the lifeblood inside, such as that of the lover doomed to exile at the end of “Sonnet”:</p><p>… How often on this old deserted spot\\nI’ve dropped into the wire-connected cosmos\\nmy copper coin, intaglioed and crested,\\ndespairing, in an effort to prolong\\nthe moment of togetherness … Alas,\\na man who knows not how to substitute\\nhimself for a whole world is usually left\\nto spin the telephone’s pockmarked dial\\nas if it were a table at a seance,\\nuntil the shade replies in echo voice\\nto terminal screams ringing in the night.</p><p>It was the same gift whenever a Brodsky poem appeared in a journal, magazine, or newspaper of the time. For they were not only poems, but news, missives from the outposts of Brodsky’s scattered transatlantic existence. This became particularly so in 1977, after Brodsky gained U.S. citizenship, and thus the security of a passport. Venice, Florence, Rome, Amsterdam, Paris, Mexico, Brazil, Sweden, London, San Francisco—one never knew where Brodsky was going to report from next, nor did it matter. Wherever he landed the outlook was always the same—the reason being, as he notes in his own translation of “North of Delphi,” “To man, every perspective empties / itself of his silhouette, echo, smell,” while “the pen creaking across the pad / in limitless silence is bravery in miniature.”</p><p>For many people, the stance of the globetrotting poet wore thin, seeming not so much a different orbit as a well-polished act, particularly the more his celebrity and fortune grew. Also troubling was his growing insistence on translating himself, or at best laying siege to the efforts of his faithful translators by elbowing his way into their versions with more “accurate” renderings, but versions that sometimes sounded tin-eared and clunky, their enjambment awkward and offbeat. This tension grew as Brodsky composed more and more original poems in English, many of them sounding like watered-down Auden, such as his “Bosnia Tune,” which argues, “While the statues disagree, / Cain’s version, history / for its fuel tends to buy / those who die.” But in the best of them “the wan flat voice” prevails, such as in “Törnfallet” from 1993, in which the poet imagines his widow circling a meadow in Sweden after his death, before concluding,</p><p>Painted by a gentle dawn\\none is proud that like one’s own\\nplanet now one will not wince\\nat what one is facing, since</p><p>putting up with nothing whose\\ncompany we cannot lose\\nhardens rocks and—rather fast—\\nhearts as well. But rocks will last.</p><p>Brodsky became a better poet in English, not only because his English attained near native proficiency (in the 15 years I knew him, I only once heard him search for a term he didn’t know, and that was “railroad tie”), but also because age and illness curbed his ambition, or better yet, his lack of inhibition in the grand Russian style. What did not lessen was the acuity of his vision, as well as his ability to embody what he also saw as the strength of American poetry, its “relentless nonstop sermon on human autonomy; the song of the atom, if you will, defying the chain reaction. Its general tone is that of resilience and fortitude, of exacting the full look at the worst and not blinking” (“An Immodest Proposal”).</p><p>Nostalgia is a feeling connected much more to places than to people. When asked whether he wanted to return to Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Brodsky would only say that, if he did, it would be because of a desire to see again an apartment or two, “places, not faces,” as he put it. Like many people, I miss visiting him and talking about poetry and life, but if I really think about it, the places are what I long to revisit—the apartment on Morton Street in Greenwich Village, or the open-beamed semidetached apartment at the back of Rawson House in South Hadley, Massachusetts, or drinks and dinner at what was then Woodbridge’s Inn up the street. But when revisited, they remain just places, emptied of Brodsky’s glowing presence and speech, the “Kisses! Kisses!” he offered everyone in parting. Or his quizzical advice, when I once despaired of finding a fit role in the world, “My dear Peter, don’t we all serve by default?” Or his spirited response, “Now, this is something! This is something! ” when at his kitchen table in South Hadley, I showed him a photo of my toddler twin daughters and told him one bore the middle name of Josephine.</p><p>This all came home to me on a fresh spring day in 2015 when I found myself walking past 44 Morton Street for old times’ sake. The super was outside, hosing down the sidewalk, and when I looked in through the ground-floor window, I could see the whole apartment was open and under renovation. Since no one seemed to be around, I asked if I might walk down the alley to the back garden onto which Brodsky’s former living room–study opened. I figured that just seeing the trees and brickwork patio would be a comfort, but then I saw, standing outside, awaiting disposal, the refrigerator from the old apartment, its door removed and leaning against the wall, and inside its exposed cavity the abandoned travel carrier for Brodsky’s cat, Mississippi, a name he gave it because he thought cats liked sibilants far more than fricatives. All I could think of was what the poet had told me in “A Part of Speech,” right from the start:</p><p>Peter Filkins is a poet and translator. His collections of poetry include What She Knew. His translation of the complete poems of Ingeborg Bachmann, Songs in Flight, was named an outstanding translation by the American Literary Translators Association. His most recent book is H. G. Adler: A Life in Many Worlds.</p><p>In this essay from our Autumn 2012 issue, N. S. Thompson writes of the 1936 British documentary Night Mail, a 25-minute ode to the British General Post Office. The highlight of the film, he writes, is its closing sequence, a collaboration between poet W. H. Auden and composer Benjamin Britten that could evoke a sense of awe in even the most cynical of mail recipients.</p><p>\\n                            Sponsored by Phi Beta Kappa\\n                            Copyright © 2018\\n                            Phi Beta Kappa\\n                            \\n                            Privacy Policy\\n                        </p>\",\"date\":\"2020-9-2\",\"link\":\"https://theamericanscholar.org/words-preserved-against-a-day-of-fear/#.X06wZMhKiUk\",\"discrp\":\"What Joseph Brodsky was able to set in motion: \\\"Not the limits of a meager idea, but the activity of thought itself.\\\"  .\",\"visibility\":\"unseen\"}"]
