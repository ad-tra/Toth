  "content": "<p>This week, with much fanfare, the Women’s Prize for Fiction, together with its sponsor Baileys, unveiled, as part of the prize’s twenty-fifth anniversary celebrations, a “Reclaim Her Name” project: twenty-five novels whose women authors were originally published under male pseudonyms, now reissued with the author’s “real” or non-pen names, displayed on covers designed by a host of international illustrators, also all women. Available to download as e-books, with physical boxsets being supplied to libraries, the project, according to Bailey’s and the prize, is “finally giving female writers the credit they deserve”. </p><p>Well intentioned and laudable though this aim is, one may also\nargue that it misses the point of the pseudonymous writer, and the difference between\nthe public and the private self, let alone the question of self-identification.\nThese are subjects that should be treated with more sensitivity in these\npluralistic times. </p><p>Does George Eliot, whose Middlemarch\nis featured here, really need “reclaiming” as Mary Ann Evans? The “Reclaim Her Name”\nbio glibly states that Eliot was “forced to use a male pen name”, as if she\nwere incapable of making her own decisions. \n“George Eliot” was Evans’s public persona, with, surely, no need for\nretrospective correction. By the time\nMiddlemarch was published, the reading public was fully aware of its author’s\nreal identity. Besides, by 1871/72, when Middlemarch\nfirst appeared in instalments, the name she was known by was Marian Evans\nLewes, as the common-law wife of her partner George Henry Lewes. According to\nthe Oxford Dictionary of National\nBiography, “Mary Ann” was not used by Eliot from 1851 until 1880, the last\nyear of her life, when she chose “Mary Ann Cross” on her marriage to John\nWalter Cross. Intentions matter, but so does legacy. Is it really for others to\nspeak for Eliot/Evans and designate a different agency? </p><p>The writer Vernon Lee, meanwhile, whose supernatural fiction\nand art criticism should certainly be better known, has her gothic horror novel\nThe Phantom Lover republished under\nViolet Paget, a name that Lee – a lesbian and a feminist –  chose, in her life as in her writing, and for\nher own reasons, to cast off. (I had to double-check that Radclyffe Hall, the author\nof The Well of Loneliness, doesn’t\nappear in this list,  unwillingly recast\nwith her birth, or “dead name” of Marguerite.)</p><p>Indiana, published in 1832 under “the male pseudonym used by the\n19th century French novelist Amantine Aurore Dupin” (according to the BBC\nwebsite) is also given a make-over. Again, this is misleading. It was Sand who\nwas the novelist, not Dupin. “George Sand” was as much a part of her image as\nthe men’s clothes she wore and the tobacco she openly smoked. (Indiana was the first novel Sand\npublished independently under her chosen pen name.) Sand was the most popular\nwriter in Europe of any gender by the age of twenty-seven, and enjoyed greater\npopularity in England during the 1830s and 40s than her fellow French novelists\nHonoré du Balzac or Victor Hugo, the latter of whom, at his funeral eulogy for her\nin 1876 commented: “George Sand was an idea. She has a unique place in our age”.\nAnd yet “Reclaim Her Name” sums her up with the line: “her romances were known\nworldwide. It’s time her name was too”.</p><p>On the other hand, Liz Petry, the daughter of Ann Petry, perhaps best known as the author of The Street, is delighted that her mother’s novel Marie of the Cabin Club, which originally appeared in 1939 under the pseudonym Arnold Petri, is being bought out under her real name. “I’m incredibly proud of my mother’s work and it excites me that her writing has been introduced to a new audience”, she said. This rectifying seems entirely fitting for Petry, a writer who went on to publish under her own name; but the troubling aspect of the Bailey’s project is that its rather superficial analysis and one-size-fits-all approach overlooks the complexities of publishing history, in which pseudonyms aren’t always about conforming to patriarchal or other obvious standards. The relentless obsession in recent years with the “unmasking” of the writer who goes by the name of Elena Ferrante is a case in point, as is the fact that writers the world over routinely use pseudonyms or anonymity because of fear of prosecution or even death. </p><p>There is a danger here of being ahistorical rather than historically accurate. Virago Press, which launched its first modern classic in 1978, beginning a list of women writers who were then largely forgotten, notably kept the pen name of George Egerton, the author of Keynotes. Keynotes is republished by the “Reclaim Her Name” project under the name Mary Bright, although Egerton was born Mary Chavelita Dunne, and “Golding Bright” was her husband’s surname. “Mary Bright”, therefore, seems to be a name of the project’s own making.  </p><p>In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, male writers\nused women’s names in order to publish certain types of fiction viewed as,\nwell, unmanly. Women authors often reverted to anonymity rather than\npseudonymity – for example by publishing work as “by A Lady”. (The first\nedition of Frankenstein in 1818 was\npublished anonymously, with Mary Shelley’s name first appearing in the second\nedition of 1821.)  It is indisputably the\ncase that women writers were frequently marginalized, patronized and dismissed\nas frivolous, and for that reason –  but\nnot only that reason – chose a male pen name. (The intensely\nprivate Ellis Bell, better known as Emily Brontë, was horrified when she was\nrevealed as the author of Wuthering\nHeights.) The commercial aspects of author’s names should not be\noverlooked, either. Writers want to sell their books in an uncertain market –\nas true 150 years ago as it is today. </p><p>My first graduate job, in the early 1990s, was at the British Library, where I would spend hours cataloguing nineteenth-century books as part of an early digitization project. Piles of Victorian three-decker novels, by writers using real names, pseudonyms or none at all were retrieved from the book stacks, their uncut pages a sad testament to the fact that no one but me had touched them in years. This is one of many genuinely unvisited tombs of literature (to paraphrase the final line of Middlemarch) which “Reclaim Her Name” might like to consider for any future projects.  </p><p>Catherine Taylor is a freelance writer and critic who has been publisher at The Folio Society and deputy director of English PEN </p>",

  "content": "<p>In August 2017, a few weeks before the fall semester began at Cornell University, I received an email inviting me to participate in a campaign called “I’m First!” The idea was to encourage “faculty and staff on campus to identify themselves, via T-shirt or button, as the first in their family to graduate from a four-year institution.” The rationale for this themed costume party was the following: “This visual campaign will allow first-generation students to clearly identify (and connect with) faculty and professional staff that have had similar experiences as them!” Though I have been a tenured professor at Cornell for eleven years, neither of my parents, who are French, pursued post-secondary education. My father finished high school; my mother learned stenography at a vocational school and got her first job at sixteen. I guess this made me an ideal candidate to wear the nice T-shirt provided by the administration. But I declined. I’m not ashamed of my background, and I don’t underestimate the challenges students face when they are the first in their family to attend college. But the two occurrences of the verb “to identify” in one eight-line paragraph were clear hints that the I’m First! initiative—part of a national campaign—was pushing a new social identity: “first-gen.”</p><p>The next fall, a long article in the Cornell magazine Ezra featured administrators attesting to the remarkable progress of this new identity. Judging by their comments, first-gen persons would no longer need a button: their nature was now self-evident. One administrator spoke of the difficulty for first-generation students of “walking onto a college campus and maybe not seeing someone who looks like you.” Another suggested that the same students “benefit from having spaces in which to be themselves; to see leadership staff, other students and even artworks that look like them.” I wondered: Do I look first-gen enough? Is it okay if I wear a bow tie or a skirt? Should I speak loudly or be shy? More seriously, what if art or education are, in my view, valuable precisely as a way of becoming other? If I defy expectations, am I untrue to myself, or to the manufactured self that others think I should reclaim? The collection of presumed tastes, behaviors, desires, aspirations, and appearances that come with an externally defined identity rejects in advance anyone who doesn’t conform. “Intersectionality”—or bearing several identities simultaneously—does not change this conundrum; it simply adds additional prescriptions.</p><p>It goes without saying that what happens on my campus is in no way unique and that being a first-gen is only one relatively novel option in a continuously growing list of what every one of us is supposed to be. American academia is a hotbed of proliferating identities supported and largely shaped by the higher ranks of administrators, faculty, student groups, alumni, and trustees. Not all identities are equal in dignity, history, or weight. Race, gender, and sexual orientation were the three main dimensions of what in the 1970s began to be called identity politics. These traits continue to be key today. But affirmed identities are mushrooming. The slightest shared characteristic, once anchored in a narrative of pain, can give rise to a new group. There is now a rural identity, a peanut-allergic identity, a fat identity, an ADHD identity, and so on. Each comes with stories of humiliation or of life-threatening experiences, with demands for official recognition, with products specifically targeted to the group, and with the sort of people the writer Touré called, in Who’s Afraid of Post-Blackness?, “the self-appointed identity cops.” Whereas identity politics, as theorized four decades ago, aimed to liberate the oppressed and to oppose American capitalism, its main form today is more invested in changing the direction of domination and in multiplying restrictions. It is the social order of the day, its rhetoric ubiquitous in the neurotic centers of the American economy (universities, the media, the tech sector).</p><p>Under this regime, identities, once affirmed, are indisputable. If I say, “As an x, I think. . . ,” I am no longer voicing an opinion that can be evaluated or critiqued within a shared space of discourse; I am merely saying what I am. If you disagree with me, you may trace everything I say back to my identity before availing yourself of corresponding counterarguments: you say a because you are an x, but I am a y and I therefore believe in b. Such identities, I insist, are not emancipatory, neither at the psychological nor at the political level. We all should have the right to evade identification, individually and collectively. What’s more, identity politics as now practiced does not put an end to racism, sexism, or other sorts of exclusion or exploitation. Ready-made identities imprison us in stereotyped narratives of trauma. In short, identity determinism has become an additional layer of oppression, one that fails to address the problems it clumsily articulates.</p>",

  "content": "<p>Triumph of the Will, the 1935 Nazi propaganda film directed by Leni Riefenstahl in Nuremberg, comes up twice in the final volume of Karl Ove Knausgaard’s six-volume autobiographical novel, My Struggle. Both mentions of the film occur in the midst of Knausgaard’s epic tangent on Hitler’s autobiography and the rise of National Socialism in Europe.</p><p>The first comes during a discussion of the conversion of Martin Heidegger and other German intellectuals to Nazism. Quoting a German journalist on how Nazism provided a “widespread feeling of deliverance, of liberation from democracy,” Knausgaard indicates the sense we can get of “this aspect of the Third Reich—the popular demonstrations, the torchlit parades, the songs, the sense of community, all of which were unconditional joys to anyone who participated—by watching Riefenstahl’s films of the Nuremberg Rally… where all these elements are present.” Precisely because Riefenstahl’s film was so meticulously staged, Knausgaard alleges, it is striking how its “content far eclipses the fact, because emotions are stronger than all analyses, and here the emotions are set free. This is not politics, but something beyond. And it is something good.”</p><p>Knausgaard does not mean “good” in the moral sense. He refers to the feelings of the people involved in the marches and parades. As he does throughout the four-hundred page section, Knausgaard attempts to reconstruct the thoughts and emotions of those who were attracted to National Socialism, under the principle that it is impossible to understand the emergence of Nazism—“the last major utopian movement in the west”—without understanding what moved the people of Germany, and later of other European countries, to embrace it. And what moved them, in Knausgaard’s view, was not the Nazis’ promise to redistribute income, or Hitler’s analysis of world affairs, or even, initially, their hatred of the Jews. What moved them was, rather, the joyful feeling of togetherness and community, of being able to transcend not only the fragmented democracy of the Weimar period but politics altogether.</p><p>“In National Socialism,” writes Knausgaard, “philosophy and politics come together at a point outside the language, and beyond the rational, where all complexity ceases, though not all depth.” Riefenstahl’s film communicates the pleasure the people experienced—how “good” it felt to them—at having escaped the quotidian chaos of their shabby republic and their trivial private lives, at being liberated from the restrictions of rationality and deliberation, at being on the brink of achieving something large and lasting, deep and simple.</p><p>A similar focus on the emotional wellsprings of Nazi politics is evident in an important but largely overlooked recent film, which opens with black and white footage from Triumph of the Will. At the beginning of Terrence Malick’s A Hidden Life, we see—in lieu of opening credits—images of Hitler in the open cockpit of a plane descending through the mist as he lands for the rally in Nuremberg, Hitler standing before a teeming square of Nazis in neat lines, Hitler riding in his cavalcade through the streets. The film then shifts abruptly to the mountain town of Sankt Radegund, in the Austrian countryside, which appears at first to exist in total isolation from the opening tableau.</p><p>Against a backdrop of green hills and blue skies, we are introduced to Franz, a farmer and father, along with his mother, his wife, Fani, and their three young daughters. There are no military parades in Radegund, and, in the consciousness of the farmers, there seems to be hardly any politics. Fani’s and Franz’s lives are consumed by their faith, their work on the land, and their family. They live in what appears to be a fairytale innocence.</p><p>The fairytale ends when Fani is shown looking skyward, alarmed at the sound of planes buzzing overhead. The war has arrived, and Franz is soon sent to a training camp for the German army. At the military camp, Franz watches quizzically as the recruits are shown filmed images—projected on an outdoor screen—of Nazis marching victoriously through foreign cities in flames. But the propaganda has the opposite of the effect it is supposed to have on Franz. When he is called to fight again, Franz informs the recruiters that he won’t go. Later, he resolves not to serve Hitler in any way.</p><p>Based on the life and letters of Franz Jägerstätter, a farmer born in Radegund in 1907, later beatified by the Catholic Church, the character cites his faith in God and his love for Fani as his inspirations for refusing to do what everyone around him does without exception and, in most cases, without hesitation. When asked to articulate his reasons, he says little; when challenged with the fact that his resistance will “change nothing,” he merely nods. Offered a chance to avoid military service if only he will sign an oath of loyalty to Hitler, Franz refuses. He is taken from his wife, mother, and daughters, then imprisoned, tortured, and eventually executed. In Radegund, his family is outcast from the community and deprived of wartime rations.</p><p>Some critics of A Hidden Life have bemoaned the film’s lack of historical detail, pointing out that hardly anything is said about concentration camps or about the intricate political circumstances that prepared the way for Nazism. According to The New Yorker’s Richard Brody, Malick uses Nazi Germany “emblematically,” as a merely metaphorical backdrop to “illustrate the ultimate clash of good and evil, the ultimate price of resistance.” Likewise, The New York Times’s A.O. Scott lamented that Nazism is “depicted a bit abstractly, a matter of symbols and attitudes and stock images rather than specifically mobilized hatreds.” These criticisms not only miss Malick’s point, they invert it.</p><p>Malick, like Knausgaard, thematizes the “symbols and attitudes” of Nazism because he perceives how central these were to the appeal of Nazism itself. The film demonstrates impressionistically what Knausgaard, with his characteristic thoroughness, lays out in voluminous excerpts of diary entries and contemporaneous accounts from the period: the “goodness” of Nazism was as much about its symbols and attitudes as it was about its policies and actions. But the appeal A Hidden Life makes as an artistic experience is the opposite of symbolic. For the contemporary viewer, the film’s power flows from the fact that, whatever political and social convulsions led to the moment when Fani cranes her neck skyward, individual Germans like Franz and Fani were confronted by a choice that remains perfectly legible today.</p><p>Some at the time may not have felt Nazism to be a choice at all. History nevertheless records that there were, without any doubt, resisters. The existence of these resisters has “proved crucial to establishing a kind of ex post facto moral compass,” writes Rand Richards Cooper in Commonweal magazine, “reminding Germans—rather in the way that the witness of passionate nineteenth-century abolitionists reminds Americans regarding slavery—that a point of moral sanity was in fact visible to some, and thus available to all.”</p><p>How does Franz achieve this moral sanity? That is the central question of A Hidden Life, and it is in how he addresses it that Malick’s critics find special cause for complaint. Scott, at the end of his review, confesses that his incomprehension of Franz’s motives may be related to his personal preference for “historical and political insight over matters of art and spirit.” It is refreshing to hear a critic be so honest about their intellectual biases. It is also revealing of the assumptions that seem to pervade the broader discussion in recent years—carried on mostly by academics and op-ed writers, as opposed to artists—about the relationship between the politics of 1930s Europe and those of our own time. But what if the capacity to appreciate the relevance of Nazism to our own time is, in fact, inseparable from our willingness to attend seriously to “matters of art and spirit”?</p><p>Knausgaard finished his novel—and Malick likely started working on his film—well before Trump took office, so it is misleading to think of their artworks as “responses” to the events of the past four years. Nevertheless, and partly for that reason, they offer a useful vantage point from which we can evaluate not only our own relation to that past, but also the limitations of the intellectual tools we have tended to turn to when trying to articulate that relation.</p><p>Beginning not long after the 2016 election with the historian Timothy Snyder’s bestseller Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century (2017), soon followed by the philosopher Jason Stanley’s How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them (2018), numerous scholars have sought to use historical analysis of the Weimar period to alert Americans to the early signs of fascistic rule. As the Trump presidency has dragged on, these urgent warnings have given way to a wide-ranging debate, including in these pages, about whether such historical analogies are warranted or appropriate.</p><p>Understood in relation to that debate, Malick’s and Knausgaard’s artistic treatments of Nazism may persuade us not of the inaccuracy or inappropriateness of such analogies, but of their utter and complete futility—at least insofar as it is claimed such comparisons can inoculate us against repetition. In their focus on the emotional pull of Nazism—its promise to liberate citizens from the frustrations and banalities of an alienated, lonely existence, to connect them with a mass of like-minded souls in “unconditional joy”—the works of Malick and Knausgaard expose us to aspects of how fascism works that it would be laughable to think could yield to academic analysis, no matter how accessibly arranged.</p><p>“Establish a private life,” warns Snyder. “Listen for dangerous words.” Do we really imagine it was advice such as this that interwar Germans lacked?</p><p>The second time Triumph of the Will comes up in Book Six of My Struggle, Knausgaard reflects that “Nazi Germany was the absolute state. It was the state its people could die for.”</p><p>Watching Riefenstahl’s film of the rallies in Nuremberg, its depiction of people almost paradisiac in its unambiguousness, converged upon the same thing, immersed in the symbols, the callings from the deepest pith of human life, that which has to do with birth and death, and with homeland and belonging, one finds it splendid and unbearable at the same time, though increasingly unbearable the more one watches, at least this was how I felt when I watched it one night this spring, and I wondered for a long time where that sense of the unbearable came from, the unease that accompanied these images of the German paradise, with its torches in the darkness, the intactness of its medieval city, its cheering crowds, its sun, and its banners… [and] I came to the conclusion… that it came… from something in the images themselves, the sense being that the world they displayed was an unbearable world.</p><p>Once again, the emphasis is on the affective allure of this “paradisiac” world, the pleasure that is involved in sublimating one’s individual will to the mythic collective. To make one feel justified in dying for one’s country is, in some sense, the greatest gift a country can bestow on an individual. And yet Knausgaard, watching the film as an adult in a liberal democracy more than seventy years later, finds it “unbearable.” What is it in this world—or, more precisely, in “these images” of it—that are so unbearable to Knausgaard?</p><p>One of the chief insights yielded by Knausgaard’s close reading of Mein Kampf is that Hitler, for all his vehement disgust with modernity, was “one of us.” He was modern and Western in the sense that he was secular yet wanted some larger meaning; modern and Western insofar as he craved something that the rationalized, bureaucratic nation-state is organized to exclude. To say that Knausgaard arrived at this insight by making an analogy between Hitler’s time and our own would be to miss its force, for the analogy presumes a distance requiring some leap of imagination—or historical scholarship—in order to bridge it. In fact, no such distance exists.</p><p>At the dawn of the twentieth century, Knausgaard recounts, large portions of Western high society “closed the door” on religion, while millions were uprooted from their communities and traditions, often settling in overcrowded cities teeming with poverty, exploitation and, soon, militarism. If we can only clear our eyes of self-serving fantasies, Knausgaard believes, we will see that we are still living, spiritually if not quite synchronously, in that century, and that its problems are still our problems. Among the largest of these is how individuals cut off from religion and tradition can satisfy their craving for meaning and transcendence, how they may connect with that “deepest pith” of human life.</p><p>Knausgaard acknowledges the salience of this problem, and also the ugliness of the ways many modern societies have endeavored to solve it. His artistic project in My Struggle may be viewed, in one respect, as an argument for art, rather than politics, as the proper place to explore the transcendent. Throughout the six volumes, Knausgaard strives to make contact with the “inexhaustible” feelings—feelings he associates with experiences of joy, beauty, plenitude, ecstasy, and reverence—that he believes are suppressed in so much of modern, secular life. In Book Six, he emphasizes that these emotions are also at work in Riefenstahl’s film, and that they speak to some of the elemental forces that drove Nazi ideology. But whereas Riefenstahl intentionally blurs the line between aesthetic feelings and political ones, Knausgaard insists on the necessity of segregating them. In contrast to the undifferentiated masses that populate Riefenstahl’s “German paradise,” the responsible modern artist anchors their artistic vision in distinctive personal experience, which they invest with what Knausgaard calls “the inimitable tone of the particular.”</p><p>But even within art, Knausgaard argues, the Nazi experiment has had its effect. So complete was the catastrophe of Nazism that it warns us not only against the danger of utopianism in politics, but also against the danger of utopianism in any collective cultural endeavor, including art. Knausgaard laments the extent to which Western art after Nazism has been oriented toward ideas (the cerebral, the critical) rather than toward the emotions (the passionate, the inexpressible), but his novel, about the life of a bourgeois man raising his family, demonstrates that even he does not wish completely to disavow this orientation. Indeed, as many critics have noted, Knausgaard surrounds his musings on the transcendent with thousands of pages documenting a man making cereal, tidying his children’s bedrooms, checking his email, and agonizing over whether he should get off the couch to make another cup of tea.</p><p>The prosaicness of My Struggle is, in this light, an act of prudence and self-limitation: while expressing his perennial attraction to the “inexhaustible” emotions, Knausgaard never forgets their danger. The long digression on Hitler—the culmination of Knaugaard’s book-length Kampf against what he takes to be his own Hitlerian impulses—ends with Knausgaard’s remembering the moment he felt most powerfully the stirrings of the “we” he associates with fascism: in the aftermath of Anders Breivik’s summer camp mass shooting outside of Oslo in 2011.</p><p>This “we” emerged amid a moment of national mourning and grief, and yet Knausgaard still perceives in it the germ of a potentially fascist collectivity. Even sitting alone, as he writes the final portion of his book from his home office in Malmö, a medium-sized city in Sweden, where he lives with his wife and his (then) three children, Knausgaard recognizes in himself a desire he identifies with Nazism: to reach beyond the dull comforts and tedious complications of bourgeois democratic life. But he also knows something the Germans marching in Riefenstahl’s film did not know, and this thing compels him to resist this desire, as it relates to politics and even to art.</p><p>What makes Riefenstahl’s film unbearable to Knausgaard is that he knows the catastrophic endpoint of the joyful, torchlit parade. We might even say My Struggle in its entirety is an investigation of the liberal-democratic self—in its nobility as well as in its banality—that has been shaped by the knowledge of where Hitler’s parade of the “we” ends.</p><p>Malick, too, knows where this parade ends, yet he comes to a conclusion different from Knausgaard’s about how art might be meaningful after Auschwitz. In a review that chided the film for its “heavy-handed moralism,” the critic Lidija Haas observed that it was “hard to tell whether it’s an intentional irony” that Malick begins A Hidden Life by showing a “fantasia” of a mountain community that a “fascist would adore.” I don’t see anything ironic about it, but Malick’s romantic evocation of life in the mountains, in a movie that begins with footage from Riefenstahl, could hardly be accidental.</p><p>Before her Nazi period, Riefenstahl both starred in and directed a series of “mountain films” that were reputedly admired by Hitler. In these films, wrote Susan Sontag in her famous essay on fascist aesthetics, the “mountain is represented as both supremely beautiful and dangerous, that majestic force which invites the ultimate affirmation of and escape from the self.” A Hidden Life also makes use of a majestic romantic imagery: the mountains shrouded in mist form the backdrop for more than one scene in which a farmer is tilling the fields at dusk. That this imagery is deployed in a film devoted to resistance to Nazism, however, might inspire us to ask whether it is necessary—or wise—to abandon the field of the emotional sublime to the fascists.</p><p>Ever since Walter Benjamin observed, in the epilogue to his much-cited 1935 essay “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” that the logic of fascism was toward “the introduction of aesthetics into political life,” Western artists have gravitated toward one of two paths. Many leftwing artists, suspicious not only of the aestheticization of politics but of any emotional appeal not immediately assimilable to their political purposes, have taken part in a counterattack that culminates, as Benjamin predicted it would, in the full “politicization of art”—that is, the reduction of art to agitprop. Liberals and many conservative writers have, on the other hand, predominantly done as Knausgaard recommended and tried to sequester aesthetics within the artistic sphere, even there taking care not to let things get out of hand.</p><p>An appreciation of the full spiritual force of movements like Nazism might encourage us to countenance a third alternative, one that acknowledged the centrality of symbolism and emotion to political life, and deployed them against the eroticized collectivism that is so evident in Riefenstahl’s film. This aesthetics would honor the triumph, we might say, not of the collective will, that threatening “we,” but of the individual conscience.</p><p>Midway through A Hidden Life is an arresting tableau: Hitler, again in grainy film footage, appears in uniform, playing with a little boy on the viewing deck of his retreat in the Bavarian mountains, the sun glittering off the mountainside behind him. The interlude—beautiful but haunting (haunting because beautiful)—underscores, just as the film’s opening does, the aesthetic and emotional appeal of the Nazi project. Malick does not shrink from this appeal, but neither does he allow it to shrink his own ambition as an artist. In a film that begins with Riefenstahl’s footage, the very worst that can ensue from the politicization of such ambitions is in full view. But A Hidden Life rather than being intimidated into modesty by fascist art, presents a countervailing utopia to the völkisch collectivist one, holding out the prospect of a different kind of “escape from the self.”</p><p>It is not incidental to Franz’s story that, for him, religion is still an open door. Christianity provides both the substance and the inspiration for the orienting world “beyond” politics in A Hidden Life. Of course, as the film depicts, plenty of churchgoing Christians were among Nazism’s most enthusiastic supporters. And conversely, the aesthetic power of Malick’s late films, even as they have grown more explicitly Christian in their imagery and message, is perfectly accessible to many of us who are not Christians. Christianity, in these films, is one among many educators of the moral sentiments, one among many reminders that ethical action is not dependent on “historical and political insight” and often will remain unmoved by it. Art can be another such educator.</p><p>“I have this feeling,” Franz tells the Nazi judge who presides over his trial. “If God gives us free will, we’re responsible for what we do—or what we fail to do. I can’t do what I believe is wrong.” Franz’s belief, like the beliefs of the fascists, is based on a feeling. This why his “resistance” has seemed opaque to those more accustomed to researching and factchecking their way to virtue, but it is precisely what gives his story its relevance in a period in which a new emotional sincerity is spreading throughout our political life, often overpowering our liberal-democratic caution about political passions.</p><p>Yet, in contrast to the fascists, Franz does not clothe his moral feeling in self-certainty; still less does he attempt to transform it into dogmatic judgment. Rather, he accepts that his decision is vulnerable to counterarguments, including those that his wife and lawyer repeatedly put before him. He could be wrong, he acknowledges to the judge, but he cannot sign the oath. It is not only fascist feelings that are, sometimes, inexpressible.</p>",

  "content": "<p>What are we to do with Ezra Pound? One answer would be to “cancel” him, to dump his statue in some river and let the water erase it. This wouldn’t be without cause: calling his politics and personality repugnant is an understatement. But it would also be too simple. Pound’s fingerprints are everywhere: most famously on The Waste Land, but also on the careers of Yeats, Frost, William Carlos Williams, and H. D. (Hilda Doolittle); on the publication of Joyce’s Ulysses; on Imagism, Vorticism, and the “New Poetry” that emerged in Poetry a century ago. He was, inescapably, one of the pivotal figures of twentieth-century literature.</p><p>If we have to live with Pound, the necessary question is how: merely as a player in literary history or also as the author of literature still worth reading? Two recent—and very different—works offer their own ways of approaching him. Daniel Swift’s The Bughouse: The Poetry, Politics, and Madness of Ezra Pound (2017) guides a popular, if highbrow, readership through the decade Pound was institutionalized at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C.; while Timothy Billings’s Cathay: A Critical Edition (2019), presents a meticulously researched textual guide to the composition of Pound’s 1915 breakthrough of translations (or “translations”) from Chinese poetry.</p><p>The Foreword, Introduction, and Editor’s Introduction to Cathay: A Critical Edition make the case that we should not really read these poems as Pound’s work, per se, but “as a link in a series of compilations, glosses, and creative rewrites,” “textual collaborations” with the original authors and the many figures who mediated Pound’s encounter with them. The narrower (and admitted) goal of this approach is to circumvent the longstanding arguments about Pound’s accuracy and authenticity as a translator and to focus on his textual process of translation—all for the best. But one can’t help noticing another effect: to separate the poetry from the poet, dissolving Pound’s authorship in order to absolve the words.</p><p>Billings performs meticulous, detailed, and traditional textual scholarship: transcribing, annotating, collating. Ultimately, these labors belie the notion that Pound’s singular authorial role could ever have been a merely contingent link in textual transmission.</p><p>Cathay, Swift’s account contends, “invents modernist poetry.” Like all claims about modernism’s origins, this is an overstatement invested in literary mythology. But its point is worthwhile: in their moment, these two dozen translations from classical Chinese poetry (and the Old English “The Seafarer”) weren’t just an obscure work of antiquities. They were living poetry—something new. Of course, translates has always been a contentious verb here: Pound didn’t know much Chinese at all. Instead, he worked from the notebooks Ernest Fenollosa, an American art historian, had used to study with two Japanese scholars, Umewaka Minoru and Mori Kainan.</p><p>For over a century, critics and scholars have argued about Pound’s methods of translating, his errors and his inventions, without careful or systematic reference to the documents from which Pound worked—despite their availability in Yale’s special collections. Billings transcribes and assembles these “cribs” as the back matter to this Cathay, the bulk of the volume. The layout does present a multi-authorial snapshot: First, the Chinese characters themselves; beneath them, the romanji transliteration; then a word-by-word gloss of literal definitions; “paraphrases” offering the sense of the whole line; and, lastly, Pound’s published translation. The five layers repeat, line-by-line, for every poem, emphasizing one of Billings’s more remarkable discoveries: that Pound’s practices of translation grew out of a traditional Japanese reading practice called kundoku, or gloss-reading. It’s a three-stage process that Ernest Fenollosa’s teachers employed: read aloud one line at a time; succinctly parse each character, including multiple meanings; create an intelligible paraphrase, or translation, of the line. The result, in the notebooks, are glosses and paraphrases that often disagree by design. As Pound translated, he erred on the side of the glosses—leading to moments of insight and of error.</p><p>Billings terms Pound’s method of working from these “the calque,” or “a transfer of lexical meanings so ‘literal’ that it imposes its foreignness unidiomatically on the new text.” In the hands of a lesser poet, this could easily be as disastrous as the floridly idiomatic renderings of late-nineteenth century translations Pound both rejected and consulted. In his critique of Richmond Lattimore’s 1967 translation of Homer, “Another Odyssey,” Guy Davenport observes that “Translation involves two languages; the translator is in constant danger of inventing a third that lies between, a treacherous nonexistent language suggested by the original and not recognized by the language into which the original is being transposed.” This is the technique of Pound’s calquing—and it highlights how essential he is to the process. The third line of “Poem by the Bridge at Ten-Shin” reads, in Fenollosa’s gloss, “Morning become cut/rend intestine flowers.” Paraphrased, it’s “In the morning they are unbearably beautiful flowers.” Neither leads inevitably to Pound’s imaginative, unidiomatic, and yet far superior, “At morning these are flowers to cut the heart.”</p><p>The English language may never see another editor quite like him. The same methods he would use to chisel his “Homage to Sextus Propertius” from the Latin, various Cantos from Latin renderings of Homer or the correspondence of Sigismondo Malatesta, or The Waste Land from Eliot’s meandering “He Do the Police in Different Voices” drives his process here. If Cathay really did invent modernism, it was by honing Pound’s editorial prowess. Cathay’s textual history may have been complex and involved the collation of multiple voices, but, inescapably, it is also the work of Pound’s idiosyncratic and erratic genius. </p><p>Billings’s Pound disappears into textual history. Swift’s was never there at all: in The Bug House, the aging, institutionalized poet is a cipher for those who come to visit him at St. Elizabeths. Encounters with his contemporaries (Eliot, William Carlos Williams), rising poets (Elizabeth Bishop, Robert Lowell, Charles Olson, John Berryman, Hugh Seidel), and his doctors guide the structure of Swift’s account of Pound’s decade there—as do other, more ephemeral figures who drift onstage from the neo-fascist margins of American and Italian politics. All find in Pound what they want (and perhaps need) to find: a model of resistance to poetic conventions, an antagonist, a mentor, an elder poet also grappling with madness; a celebrity patient; an economic and political theorist whose works root out a global conspiracy of usurists (Jews, capitalists, militarists, mongrelizers, and more Jews). Insofar as it offers these narrative snapshots of a moment in literary history, this has value: Pound serving less as a forebear than as an object of cultural significance in the 1950s, like Ozymandias’s pedestal come to life, or the ruined Lady Liberty in Planet of the Apes.</p><p>But Swift frames his study as his own attempt to visit with Pound—and as ours. “Pound at St. Elizabeths is the riddle at the heart of the twentieth century,” he writes; “Pound’s contradictions remain with us. They are the uncertainties of our time.” But after 260 pages, Swift can reach no answer. Pound is contradictory. He (and his verse) probably can’t be trusted, but also can’t be dismissed. The book’s closing image is Pound, free in 1959, waiting for the director of a BBC documentary to tell him what to do: a figure whose meaning must be created by someone else. Pound is always only what we make of him.</p><p>This is the worst of all worlds: a way of accidentally absolving Pound of his sins while dismissing the poetry as at best secondary to the empty vessel of his biography. Swift makes the same mistake many of Pound’s guests did: he visits and expects to learn something. Nearly a century after the New Criticism excised author and context from consideration, we’ve come full circle, subordinating poetry to psychology, politics, and personality. This isn’t Swift’s fault; it’s the condition both of much of what passes for literary criticism and our contemporary notion of poetry as mere “self-expression,” a way to be “heard” in all your “individuality.”</p><p>But if we’re to be totally honest, Swift’s relegation of the poetry to minimal importance isn’t entirely wrong. Much of Pound’s work—including almost all of the Cantos—simply are not worth reading or investing the time and resources of scholarship. Arguments about Pound’s politics often seem like ways to skirt the question of his literary merit. We know he’s important—but is he any good?</p><p>So let’s speak plainly. Pound was a central figure of twentieth-century literary history, without whom lasting, enduring works would not have taken the shapes they did. He was a talented, innovative poet—up until his mid-thirties. But the Cantos, on which he staked his reputation, were a failure. The modernist scholar Lawrence Rainey referred to them as “The Monument of Culture.” The truth is that they were born ruins. To find beauty in them, we have to do something like what Pound did in Cathay: read the word-by-word glosses and ignore the paraphrases. The reason is this: when we do try to make sense of them, they descend too often into secrecy, paranoia, and conspiracy. It’s not that there’s no “there” there—it’s that what is there far too often isn’t worthwhile.</p><p>Pound will endure, though, because in any honest literary history he must. The poems will, too—at least some of them, the early translations like Cathay especially. Billings’s scholarship makes the case for that—and for “The Seafarer,” “Homage to Sextus Propertius,” and the first Canto. Despite the ugliness of his person, some of what Pound created remains lastingly beautiful.  </p>",

  "content": "<p>Over​ the last forty years, academics have tried, without much success, to superimpose the idea of the Vikings as peaceful traders on the berserkers-and-horned-helmets tradition. There is little disagreement about the events of the Viking Age or its timeline, stretching from 8 June 793 (the unexpected raid on Lindisfarne) to 25 September 1066, when King Haraldr Harðráði, ‘Hard-Counsel Harald’, died at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. As Neil Price points out, all this should be seen as protohistory rather than history. The Vikings themselves couldn’t write, except for short runic inscriptions carved in wood or stone, and had no dating system beyond ‘the fourth year of King Olaf’ and so on. Royal succession was the only way to mark time. The sequence of events we refer to as the Viking Age was put together from the accounts of their many victims, from Ireland to Byzantium.</p><p>Price’s book, however, centres on ‘what made [the Vikings] tick, how they thought and felt’. How much money did they make? How much labour went into fitting out a Viking fleet? What did Vikings think happened to women when they died? (Warriors, of course, went to Valhalla.) There are clues to this last question in excavated Viking graves, but these discoveries – Price is professor of archaeology at Uppsala University – are often inscrutable. There are logistical questions too. In considering the wealth of the Vikings, it’s impossible to ignore the island of Gotland, where hundreds of hoards of silver have been found, almost one for every farm – contributing to a total of more than a million silver dirhams found in Scandinavia and the Baltic, nine times as many as have been found in their point of origin in the Muslim Near East. It’s ‘simply not credible’, Price writes, ‘that virtually all homeowners concealed their family cash in the backyard and then died before telling anyone about it’. Later accounts claim that the Vikings believed they would enjoy their buried wealth in the afterlife. The sources aren’t reliable, but it does at least explain the phenomenon.</p><p>The biggest question, of course, is what made the Vikings so successful for so long. Western Europe was dominated by warlike monarchs and aristocracies, while Muslim Spain, the Byzantine Empire and the Caliphate of Baghdad were all in their different ways organised for warfare. Price suggests that we need a prehistory as well as a protohistory. Two traumatic events affected the northern world long before Lindisfarne. One was the collapse of the Roman Empire, a destabilisation that led to a kind of ‘gangster culture’ of unemployed mercenaries and roving warbands. Even worse, and better evidenced, were the volcanic eruptions of 536, 539/540 and possibly 547. The second, which originated from Ilopango in what is now El Salvador, threw around ninety cubic kilometres of dust, ash and aerosols into the atmosphere. The entire world suffered, but Scandinavia, with its short growing season and often marginal agriculture, suffered most. It’s thought as much as half the population died of starvation. At the heart of Norse mythology is the Fimbulwinter, three winters with no summers in between, which may once have been a fact.</p><p>In desperate circumstances, the poor die but the survivors expand their holdings. The famine may well have strengthened the post-Roman militarised elites who have left their traces in the giant mounds and boat-burials of Uppsala and Valsgärde, and the enormous wooden hall at Borg in Norway, which at 270 feet long is as big as a cathedral. Another hall at Uppsala had door hinges made of spears, their points facing towards the centre, so that you entered through a weapon portal: all part of ‘a dazzling material culture of killing’. But there were few ways to pay for this in the middle of the long post-Roman slump, which entailed the disruption of established markets. Raiding must have looked very attractive.</p><p>Price also notes the significance of the Vikings’ gender imbalance. Norse society was not exactly polygamous, for monogamy was normal, but it was polygynous. Rich men and royalty had wives, subsidiary wives and concubines, sometimes, according to an 11th-century treatise by Adam of Bremen, ‘in unlimited number’. An unbalanced ‘socio-sexual economyʼ was probably made worse by the habit in warlike societies of rearing baby boys more carefully than girls, leading to female infanticide by neglect. Skeleton studies in Sweden show that about 7 per cent of Viking men were malnourished as children, compared to 37 per cent of women. Elite monopolisation and differential survival rates must have created an underclass of what we would now call ‘involuntary celibates’, disaffected young men, angry, desperate and easy to recruit.</p><p>In one of several vignettes, Price imagines a younger son on the impoverished west coast of Norway, whose childhood sweetheart has a new brooch: a present from a boy who spent a successful summer raiding. What is young Orm or Gunnar going to do? Not only does he need money for the bride-price paid to her family, he needs a reputation: ‘The act of acquiring silver was as important as the silver itself.’ And if he went raiding he might in any case acquire a woman for free. DNA has shown that ‘a very large proportion – even the majority – of female settlers in Iceland were of Scottish or Irish heritage.’</p><p>Traumatised societies, militarised elites, disaffected youths: they all help explain the Viking phenomenon. But did they think like us? Price points out that the Vikings decorated everything that had a surface, including themselves. Ibn Fadlan, the Arab traveller who met a party of the blond ‘Rus’ somewhere in Eastern Europe in the 920s – and whose horrifying account of a Viking funeral has been largely confirmed by archaeological finds – said that they were covered in what must have been tattoos. ‘Each man, from the tip of his toes to his neck, is covered in dark green lines, pictures and such like.’ No Viking skin has survived, but their teeth have. It seems there was a male fashion for filing horizontal grooves along the upper incisors, which were probably filled with coloured resin. A Viking smile must have looked very odd. But what the point of this fashion was, we don’t know.</p><p>Nor do we know what they thought about their own inner lives. Vikings recognised hamr, or ‘shape’, as more or less equivalent to ‘body’, though some people were eigi einhamr, ‘not of one shape’: they were werewolves, or worse. Hugr could correspond more or less to ‘mind’. But Vikings also seem to have thought that each of us has a hamingja, a personal ‘luck’, which can on occasion leave the body (a very bad sign). The fourth part of us is a female fylgja, a ‘follower’ or ‘fetch’, inherited from our ancestors. Price doesn’t claim to know what a ‘fetch’ does, but he writes that the belief dies hard. If you ask modern Icelanders whether they believe in elves and the huldufólk or ‘hidden people’, they will roll their eyes, but ask them about their fylgjur and you get ‘a level stare and perhaps a change of subject’.</p><p>Viking society wasn’t homogeneous. They had dealings with many different cultures and they lived in varied environments, from Danish and Swedish pasture to the sub-Arctic tundra of Norway and Iceland. In the early 11th century the best-travelled woman in the world must have been Gudrid Thorbjarnardóttir, whose remarkable journeys demonstrate the great distances the Vikings covered. She gave birth to a child in North America, met people of the First Nations and ate grapes in Vinland, made a pilgrimage to Rome and drank wine in Italy, and died as a nun in Iceland. Vikings lived in close contact with the Sámi people, whom they called Finns. In his earlier book, The Viking Way, Price pointed out that Norwegians and Swedes, at least, might be regarded as in some ways similar to the ‘circumpolar’ cultures which stretch from Greenland to Siberia, notably in what looks like shamanistic behaviour.</p><p>But the more we know about the Vikings, the harder it becomes to say anything certain about them. This applies in particular to the area for which we have most archaeological evidence – burial practices. The number of excavated Viking graves is in the low millions, and the only rule is that they’re all different. Men buried with weapons are common, but the occupant of a particularly well-furnished grave in Birka, who was buried seated with axe, sword, spears, bow and arrows, is now confirmed by DNA as female. Conversely men buried in women’s clothes and with feminine accessories have been found on several occasions, including one man buried with a full set of female jewellery near Andover. Women buried with iron staffs may have been völvur, sorceresses, practitioners of the seithr magic which was shameful for men to deal in. But Odin seems to have been the supreme exponent of just this kind of magic, so some scholars now write about ‘Odin the Queer’. Possibly, as in circumpolar cultures, all the workers of magic and sorcery were regarded as ‘differently gendered’. Shamans have a gender all their own.</p><p>It is hard to come to any overall conclusions about Viking belief from their burial practices. They performed cremation and inhumation, boat burial and barrow burial. In Sweden, birds’ eggs were often placed in cremated ashes. Burying someone with two horses could be a kind of tribute, but why bisect the horses and then swap the halves over? What explains the modest burial which, decades later, had a boat full of bodies placed over it, the keel exactly covering the grave, a ritual repeated with more boats and more men over the years? In Salme, off the coast of Estonia, two boats have been found which appear to contain forty Swedish raiders, buried displaying their battle wounds, clutching fish and birds and cuts of beef or pork. But why throw gaming pieces over them? One sword-carrier has a king placed in his mouth. Was it a mark of derision from the victors or of respect? What to make of ‘a line of burials in which every corpse clasps a smooth white pebble in their hand’? If the eggs in the ashes express hope for a new life, a hatching, then perhaps the white pebbles are symbolic eggs?</p><p>Price avoids such speculation, though we have no good explanations for this astonishing diversity. He is similarly dismissive of the idea that we can reconstruct a belief system from the ‘Norse myths’. Vikings had no accepted scripture, just stories. They had no accepted religion either, just what Price calls ‘religiolects’, differing from one another as dialects differ from a standard language. Archaeology offers harder facts and firmer conclusions in other areas. The silver hoards of Gotland are surprising enough, but they represent only a fraction of the Vikings’ take. It’s thought that as many as 125 million silver dirhams from the Caliphate of Baghdad, some 340 tonnes of metal, went north in the tenth century as payment for furs and slaves. The ninth-century payoffs from the Frankish Empire were much less substantial, but still amounted to around seven million silver pennies, a high proportion of the coins in circulation in impoverished Western Europe. The Vikings made off with ‘approximately 14 per cent of the entire monetary output of the Frankish Empire’, and that isn’t counting other kinds of loot, such as slaves.</p><p>There is also the matter of the expenditure involved in gaining the loot. Viking sails were made of greased wool and it took about fifty sheep to provide the wool for one sail. The wool had to be spun and woven: heavy, co-operative work on a great Viking loom (the ‘Song of the Valkyries’ is in the form of a work song, but the web the Valkyries are weaving from human intestines is war and death). You would be wise to have a spare sail, and the crew would need clothes and tents and cordage, all demanding more wool and grease and hemp and flax and sealskins. That would mean thirty people working for a year to fit out just one ship and its crew. The 11th-century fleets of Denmark and Norway would have required about two million sheep. As for a major warship like the one displayed at the British Museum’s Vikings exhibition in 2014, that would represent something like a year’s work for a team of eight skilled men, not counting the time taken to produce the wood and iron needed.</p><p>Price doesn’t quite describe this as a pirate economy, but he draws the parallel. In the central section of his book he offers something like a narrative history of the Viking Age, but focusing on general trends rather than single dates and events. As he sees it, the first development was ‘maritoria’, markets organised by many petty kings, especially those in geographically fragmented western Norway. These were trade centres, but were dependent on the ‘maritime military power’ exercised by leaders who bore nicknames such as ‘Cruiser’, ‘Screamer’, ‘Sails Alone’ and ‘Sails at Dusk’ (forget about ‘peaceful traders’). Even Harald Fairhair, who became a proper historical king, may have had his nickname cleaned up by later saga writers: he started off as Harald Lúfa, ‘Mophead’.</p><p>This pirate world generated what Price calls (again a term borrowed from the 17th and 18th centuries) a ‘hydrarchy’: there were no overall leaders, no pirate monarchs, and indeed no formal organisation. This made them difficult to deal with, because, as everyone soon found out, making a deal with or buying off one group of Vikings meant nothing to another. A Viking army, at least until the late stages when the kings of Denmark and Sweden (but probably not Norway) had some loose control over their subjects, was a confederation of brotherhoods bound, if at all, by temporary oaths. Gangs left and more gangs joined, depending on the opportunities available.</p><p>The ‘real catalyst’ for the big surge in Viking activity in the ninth century, Price argues, was the civil war in the Frankish Empire between the grandsons of Charlemagne. Anglo-Saxon England was already divided, and Ireland and Scotland even more so. The Vikings came in like the tide, flowing into anywhere they found a gap. In the east, the great rivers of Ukraine and Russia were like the Hudson and the St Lawrence to explorers centuries later, only these had the markets of Byzantium and Baghdad at the end.</p><p>Such​ parallels remind us that the Vikings, for all their strange customs and unknowable psychology, were more like us than we might like to admit. But there was something macabre about them. Adam of Bremen describes the strange rituals at Uppsala, where men and animals were hanged in large numbers in a sacred grove as sacrifices to the gods. Something like this has been discovered at Frösö, or ‘Frey’s Island’, in Sweden: the stump of a birch tree buried under the church altar, surrounded by human and animal bones and body parts, including those of pigs and sheep, as well as six elks and five bears. Did they even hang bears from sacred trees?</p><p>Viking funerals may have been scary affairs as well, and not just for the victims. The craftsmanship of the objects found in the Oseberg boat-burial has been much admired, but the ceremony seems to have been completed in terrible haste, as if the burial party panicked. The chamber was sealed with any old pieces of wood that were handy, hammered in so fast that the wood was dented and the nails bent or broken.</p><p>Patrick Wormald once commented that Vikings rarely seemed to have suffered from madness, though there were psychopaths like Thorgeir Hávarsson, who is said in ‘The Saga of the Fosterbrothers’ to have axed down one innocent bystander just because he looked so temptingly open to the blow. They had a code of honour. In 1012 Thorkel the Tall, a famous captain, is said by Thietmar of Merseburg to have offered everything he had, except his ship, for the life of the captured Archbishop Ælfheah of Canterbury, who had refused to pay a ransom; when Ælfheah was killed anyway, pelted with bones and finished off with an axe, Thorkel changed sides and took his men off to serve Æthelred the Unready. Perhaps he thought killing a defenceless old man was ódrengiligt, not warrior-like behaviour.</p><p>A recent scholar, considering the appalling scene of gang rape and slave murder at the Rus funeral described by Ibn Fadlan, claimed that this ought to put paid to the idea that the Vikings were heroic: they were just cruel. This is naive. Heroism and cruelty are mutually exclusive only in the world of comic books. As Price’s book makes clear, they have often gone together.</p>",

  "content": "<p>Monica Lewinsky has been making the case for years, with an eloquence and intensity born of bitter personal experience. Shame can crush an individual. It can pick up on a passing mistake and amplify it beyond recognition, with no clear end point. It can, quite literally, drive a person to death. There is no question that shame has become a genuine emotional problem in the age of social media, arguably one of the most pressing emotional issues in American society today.</p><p>The #MeToo movement has made it clear that for too long shocking behaviors have persisted in casting rooms and television studios, highlighting the vital importance of shaming in bringing these offenses to light. Add to this four years of a President who has no clear moral compass, and the need for shame in various facets of American life becomes abundantly clear.</p><p>The dilemma, if briefly stated, is inescapable: It is possible to make an almost equally compelling case for a need for more shame and for a need for less shame in the contemporary United States. Many of the same people eager to bemoan the shaming of certain individuals pile on relentlessly in shaming other behaviors. There may be no emotion, currently, that is at once so ubiquitous and so disputed.</p><p>Part of the problem, of course, is the familiar issue of intense partisanship. It is easy to identify hapless victims of shaming by the other side, while blithely engaging in the same emotional strategy in hopes of bringing that same other side to its knees. Liberals eager to jump to the defense of Lewinsky or a victim of gay-bashing show little mercy when it comes to an utterer of the n-word or an excessively randy co-worker. Not surprisingly shame may seem just fine when deployed on behalf of your own values; it’s lack of agreement on values that causes much of the problem, and we have no fix in sight.</p><p>Beyond this, however, there is confusion about the meaning of shame itself, and this is where a further discussion of where this emotion stands in contemporary American life might prove quite helpful. There is no magic solution to the problem of shame—partly because there is no imminent solution to the nation’s deep cultural divide. But a look at the various faces of shame will perhaps suggest some effective ground rules.</p><p>Two preliminaries help set the stage. First, Western society (not just the United States) is unusual in its disdain for shame. While shame has been modified almost everywhere—no society widely uses the public stocks anymore to humiliate offenders—many regions continue to accept the legitimacy of shaming as a matter of course. The Chinese, for example, openly use shaming in school discipline: In one televised episode, a boy who had damaged some school equipment was made to wear a tawdry “shaming sweater” for the rest of the day to highlight his misdeeds before his classmates. A comparable strategy in the United States would almost certainly bring a level of parental protest that would get a teacher fired. Polls of East Asian parents show a near-majority agreeing with the importance of shaming children, while the same scenario elicits essentially no support in the United States.</p><p>In evaluating the complexities of contemporary American shame, it is really useful to be aware that alternatives exist. They have clear drawbacks: Shaming societies tend to generate greater conformity, possibly a greater reluctance to innovate, and currently their proclivities can feed authoritarian political systems. But the American dilemma is not a universal one, and it has its own downsides.</p><p>Indeed, the Western campaign against shaming is itself a modern phenomenon, and this is the second preliminary to keep in mind. Before the late 18th century, there is no indication that West European or North American approaches to shaming were at all distinctive. But Enlightenment emphasis on the dignity of the individual generated a radically new approach—and one that continues to shape much of our thinking today. It was an American founding father, Benjamin Rush, who articulated the new wisdom most clearly in stating, in 1787, that “shaming is universally acknowledged to be a punishment worse than death.”</p><p>The revolutionary sentiment, furthermore, was not just idle talk. Within a few decades American states began abolishing the age-old institution of public stocks. Parents were urged to avoid using shaming in child discipline, because of the potential for damaging self-esteem (a modern term first used in the 1850s). A bit more gradually, schoolteachers incorporated some of the same wisdom, abolishing classic practices like the dunce cap.</p><p>The point is clear. The contemporary concern about the damage shame does has been recognized for quite a while, though it is distinctively modern and disproportionately Western. The result has been a measurable diminution in a host of behaviors that once seemed commonplace. And the anti-shame movement has steadily added momentum: the shaming of unwed mothers or gays, to take two vital examples, has visibly diminished, again with Western societies usually in the lead.</p><p>The precedent of attacking shame in the name of individual dignity has of course been greatly enhanced in recent years. Testimony of individuals like Monica Lewinsky joins with the publicity given to tragedies such as the suicide of a Rutgers student publicly identified as gay by a roommate. Psychologists studying shame uniformly point to its (usually) harmful results. Convicted criminals who are shamed often relapse in part because of their resentment of the emotional burden—in contrast to those exposed to the kind of guilt that can be addressed through better behavior. Fat shaming more often than not drives individuals to eat more, in response to this needless emotional distress. Currently, amid the coronavirus pandemic, evidence suggests that attempting to shame people who refuse to wear masks simply makes them more defiant. Shame elicits pushback from both individuals and groups who find the emotional attack both painful and unwarranted.</p><p>At least in a Western context, where individuals are taught to resent shame, evidence mounts that the emotion is not only offensive in principle but counterproductive in practice. It is tempting simply to join the chorus, perhaps noting the progress that has been made but emphasizing the work still to be done to achieve greater agreement that shaming is bad.</p><p>There is, however, another avenue to explore, and because it is somewhat less familiar it demands more attention than the more commonplace case against shame.</p><p>We can begin with the obvious flip side of the emphasis on the longstanding modern credentials of the attack on shame: If shame has been under scrutiny for more than two centuries, why has it survived so well? Why does the problem continue to seem so pervasive?</p><p>Several explanations may combine. Some people are simply nasty and enjoy the opportunity to inflict harm on others. Modern technologies have visibly increased opportunities for random shaming, often directed against individuals with whom the attacker has no personal contact. An individual tweets a flippant comment while visiting Arlington National Cemetery, and a host of counter-tweets swarm, some truly outraged, others simply delighted at the opportunity to cause pain. There is little question that social media have made shaming a greater problem.</p><p>Then there are conservatives who simply do not buy into the fashionable dismissal of shame. In recent decades some American jurists have argued that shaming is a vital means of punishing certain kinds of offenders, from shoplifters to drunk drivers. Some parents agree, like the father who registered his daughter’s disobedience on Twitter (the issue was choice of clothing), ultimately causing her suicide. Even relatively moderate politicians like Jeb Bush have publicly mused that it would be good to restore shaming to inhibit adultery and other behaviors that threaten family life.</p><p>Add these factors together—the innovations of the Internet, nastiness, sincere conservative concerns—and a part of the dilemma is resolved. The offensive against shaming has encountered a variety of impediments, which is arguably all the more reason to press it forward more vigorously.</p><p>This is not, however, the whole story. Shaming also persists because it serves vital social functions and because, even in contemporary Western society, it can work, or at least seem to work. This other side to the argument, focused on shaming not so much as individual punishment but as social practice, is what makes the current issue so complex—and so intriguing.</p><p>We need to step back from the personal impact of shame—while not forgetting about it—and take a different look at the emotion. After all, if most human societies routinely used shame for centuries, and some still do, there may be something to the phenomenon beyond misguided venom.</p><p>In this light, the purpose of shame is the expression of group values that cannot be adequately implemented by other means—such as force of law. The group itself may enhance its sense of identity and cohesion through shaming, but the main point is the effort to enforce rules that are at once important and resistant to more bureaucratic mechanisms. Further, while shame unquestionably punishes and causes pain, its fundamental purpose is not punitive but preventive. Shaming seeks to reduce undesirable behaviors by making the adverse emotional consequences abundantly clear.</p><p>This is why, against popular impression, successful shaming regimes actually do not have to shame very often. The classic Puritan impulse to shame adulterers, for example, was only rarely deployed because of widespread awareness of potential community reaction. This means, in turn, that the pain involved was far less common than often imagined.</p><p>It is the social function of shame, and the way it can play out in practice, that most fundamentally explains why shaming continues to occur even in a cultural context that is in principle hostile. Three scenarios suggest some of the ongoing results.</p><p>First, in some cases, even today, the disciplinary function of shame is not easy to replicate by other methods. Schools offer a prime example. American teachers have clearly learned that extreme shaming is no longer acceptable. But faced with limitations on other forms of discipline—corporal punishment most obviously—and confronted with situations where more positive appeals to pride and self-esteem do not fully suffice, mild shaming may seem an inescapable option. Thus many school districts feature daily evaluations of students, expressed through colored stars made public to classmates and parents: green for good behavior but red for bad. The “bad”, pretty clearly, is meant to be remedied or, even better, prevented through the impact of mild shame.</p><p>Second, shaming plays a seemingly vital role in efforts to enforce human rights internationally, where no other reasonable measures seem available. Amnesty International thus routinely relies on shame to induce governments to rescind harsh punishments (like stoning for adultery) or release imprisoned union leaders. Shaming was central to apparently successful campaigns to induce Nike to change exploitative labor practices in Southeast Asia during the 1990s. To be sure, some governments resist global shaming—for example, the United States in its 2003 invasion of Iraq, or China with its oppression of its Uighur minority more recently—but the effort will surely continue.</p><p>Third, shaming can still seem essential in the domestic realm, where deeply-held principles confront the inadequacy of purely legal implementation. Thus anti-abortion groups feel intensely compelled to shame women as they head into a clinic, hoping as well to deter others from even showing up. Black Lives Matter, though using laws and courts where possible, openly cry shame to mobilize public support against police abuse, bringing a long tradition of invoking shame against racism into the contemporary era. Shaming is also deployed against other signs of racism, such as use of the n-word, punishing individual offenders but, even more, seeking to deter misbehavior in future. Shaming of this sort undergirds much of so-called cancel culture.</p><p>The conclusion is clear: Shaming is awful; it is desirable; its extremes can be disciplined; it is inevitable.</p><p>There is a final complexity to add to the mix before we talk about ways in which irreconcilable features can be, partially, reconciled.</p><p>Shame may have a particular role in modern democracies, in supplementing voting as a means of disciplining, or attempting to discipline, political behaviors. This is a relatively new angle, provoked by some of the disruptions of the Trump presidency, but it deserves some exploration.</p><p>Traditional monarchs, essentially by definition, were above most public shaming. Only egregious loss in war might threaten the kind of public outcry that could disgrace a king. On the other hand, many monarchs were constrained by codes of honor with an established upper class, where shaming might be deployed.</p><p>Modern authoritarian regimes use shame abundantly to punish dissent. The famous show trials of Soviet Russia were prime examples of shame-supported discipline. But there are more contemporary instances as well. The rulers themselves, however, rise above shame, often more blatantly than monarchs did, either through misinformation or sheer assertions of power.</p><p>Democracies might seem to have little need for shame as a political instrument, given the discipline of the ballot box. But clearly many democracies have sought to use shame as a supplement—for example, in both Britain and the United States, in seeking to enforce some standards of sexual morality or financial ethics on political figures between elections. Shaming may also be essential where regional political figures should be brought to account even when their own constituencies remain complacent: In the summer of 2020 for example, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez worked, with the classic goal of punishment and prevention, to shame a Florida Republican for using sexist language, even though the majority of his own district was unconcerned. Shaming may be a vital supplement in seeking responsible political behavior in a democracy.</p><p>Today, however, democratic shaming is challenged by the emergence of an elite class, “masters of the universe” types, who glory in their immunity to shame. Their attitude was perfectly encapsulated by a German financier who noted, quite simply, “shaming is for sissies.” This is the kind of attitude that fueled the misbehavior by banks and Wall Street that led to the 2008 financial crisis, and that has been embodied by Donald Trump, an ardent shamer who accepts no shame himself. The combination of shame, democracy, and claims of special exemption add yet another component to the evaluation of this complex social emotion.</p><p>How, then, does all this add up, beyond the obvious fact that it seems unrealistic, possibly undesirable, to claim hostility to every form of shame and at the same time clearly unacceptable to welcome shaming with no boundaries or concerns?</p><p>No tidy compromises emerge. One of the reasons for discussing shame is to highlight the kind of complex, ambiguous problem that invites contemplation and debate rather than decisive formulas.</p><p>Some conclusions can be ventured, however. The first is the most familiar from the anti-shame school. It is vital to remember how painful shame can be, a pain often exacerbated and prolonged in the age of social media. Compassion and moderation are essential. The lessons are all the more essential in situations where the shamers feel deeply that their cause is morally vital—which means shame from the liberal as well as the conservative side. The need for care applies in all directions. The many experts who urge the downsides and frequently counterproductive qualities of shame deserve careful attention.</p><p>This is all the more true in that shame now so often carries arguably excessive economic consequences, with companies ready to abandon any employee, vendor, or client who brushes with shame without much regard to the clarity or magnitude of the offense. The caution on the liberal side is also enhanced by the need to recognize that, rightly or wrongly, the American heartland already feels shamed by the coastal elites for higher levels of religious devotion and other qualities that arguably are not legitimate emotional targets. This does not mean that shaming for offenses on the right need be abandoned—there is little chance of that in any event, given the passions involved—but that there is extra need for moderation.</p><p>The wounding qualities of shame deserve consistent attention. This is even true in international relations, for there are clear examples of shaming efforts that worsened national behavior, just as there are counterexamples in which shame has provoked human rights reform. We know enough about shame in a variety of contexts to be careful, especially when we feel particularly righteous.</p><p>This said, shaming the little guy, of whatever political persuasion, warrants more care, particularly when social media are involved, than shaming the powerful or, even more obviously, the corporate. While it remains important to be accurate, and to be open to explanation, the importance of shaming in dealing with corporate misbehavior, often backed by consumer response, is particularly clear-cut in the contemporary world. The power and resiliency of the target matters.</p><p>Contemporary shamers, however justified, also need to be reminded of the importance of reintegration, a concept quite familiar in societies that are more comfortable with shame but which risks getting lost in the current American or Western context.</p><p>For it has become all too easy to assume that a shamed individual is branded for life, regardless of the precise nature of the offense or of efforts at apology and rehabilitation. To be sure, some tough individuals have written of their ability to live through shame: a tenured professor, for example, who inadvertently sent pornography to a class managed to live it down after a few years. But they have often done so from a protected position.</p><p>More generally, once we recognize that some shaming is inevitable, we can more clearly remember that, depending on the magnitude of the offense, shaming should usually have a clear end point. After the Chinese student mentioned earlier wore the sweater for most of the day, he was explicitly allowed to take it off before class was dismissed—a sign that he had paid his dues and could reenter the community. Similarly Hester Prynne of The Scarlet Letter was ultimately allowed to take her letter off, though she chose not to do so. Reintegration may seem hard to contemplate for targets of current opprobrium such as office-place sexual abusers or individuals guilty of racist language, but it is vital to consider how second chances might be allowed—particularly in those common shaming situations where no formal trial or defense has been involved. Along with initial moderation and compassion, reintegration offers an opportunity for balance in an emotional/social equation that can easily become unbalanced.</p><p>At the same time, particularly in a society so heavily weighted toward the rich and powerful, we must be deeply wary of individuals or groups that seem to be immune to shame, whether openly or not. Just as some shaming is inevitable and productive, so the ability to feel shame, and even better the capacity to anticipate shame in advance of a misdeed, is a vital component of responsible behavior in a contemporary democracy. “Shameability” should clearly be added to the qualities of good character we seek to identify in political or corporate leadership. We can start by recognizing that we seem to have a problem in this regard.</p><p>Just as I would want to raise a child without relying heavily on shame—a child who also learns the bad effects of shaming the vulnerable—so I would also want a child who had enough experience with shame as to feel it and wish to avoid it. Understanding of these complexities must start fairly early in life.</p><p>Shame can play a vital role in helping to guide good behavior, even though, when hauled out for specific notice, it has a lot of bad press. At the same time, it can clearly incline toward excess, making the righteous feel even better than they merit, particularly in a society more comfortable with condemning shame than examining it carefully. Anti-shaming efforts, even under the ironic banners of “shame the shamers,” are often fully justified.</p><p>We must also recognize contemporary issues that have made the classic Enlightenment attacks on shame more complicated: the pervasiveness of the Internet and the lack of agreed-upon manners for its use; the intense partisanship that so complicates moderation in virtually every category; and the existence of a group that seems to rise to power by taking delight in ignoring shaming constraints. All of this warrants attention in discussing the role of shame in the United States today.</p><p>Some shame, however, is with us to stay. The continued deployment of the emotion despite 250 years of criticism is a fact that simply must be acknowledged. Shame is part of group life. Appropriately handled, it can help regulate behaviors that might otherwise run unchecked. It plays a role in dealing with racism. It should serve as a moderating force in political life. And it will surely factor into any effort to promote responsible stewardship of the environment. This is why, along with due care, it deserves recurrent discussion as a constructive force, including its role in the kind of improvements we should be aspiring to in the next phase of our political life and in the evaluations of contemporary leadership.</p>",

  "content": "<p>A white man of the Jim Crow South, he couldn’t escape the burden of race, yet derived creative force from it.</p><p>In June 2005, Oprah Winfrey announced a surprising choice as the 55th selection for her influential book club. The coming months would be, she proclaimed, a “Summer of Faulkner,” focused on three of his novels—As I Lay Dying, The Sound and the Fury, and Light in August, available in a special 1,100-page box set weighing in at two pounds. Oprah’s website posted short videotaped lectures by three literature professors to assist readers in making sense of the writer’s notoriously demanding prose. The Faulkner trilogy quickly rose to the No. 2 spot on Amazon’s best-seller list. Some literary critics hailed Winfrey for bringing William Faulkner back into popular consciousness; others challenged any notion of recovery or revival, asking whether he had ever really gone away.</p><p>In the decade and a half since then, the issues of race and history so central to Faulkner’s work have grown only more urgent. How should we now regard this pathbreaking, Nobel Prize–winning author, who grappled with our nation’s racial tragedy in ways that at once illuminate and disturb—that reflect both startling human truths and the limitations of a white southerner born in 1897 into the stifling air of Mississippi’s closed and segregated society? In our current moment of racial reckoning, Faulkner is certainly ripe for rigorous scrutiny.</p><p>Michael Gorra, an English professor at Smith, believes Faulkner to be the most important novelist of the 20th century. In his rich, complex, and eloquent new book, The Saddest Words: William Faulkner’s Civil War, he makes the case for how and why to read Faulkner in the 21st by revisiting his fiction through the lens of the Civil War, “the central quarrel of our nation’s history.” Rarely an overt subject, one “not dramatized so much as invoked,” the Civil War is both “everywhere” and “nowhere” in Faulkner’s work. He cannot escape the war, its aftermath, or its meaning, and neither, Gorra insists, can we. As the formerly enslaved Ringo remarks in The Unvanquished (1938) during Reconstruction-era conflict over voting rights, “This war aint over. Hit just started good.” This is why for us, as for Jason and Quentin Compson in The Sound and the Fury (1929), was and again are “the saddest words.” As Gorra explains, “What was is never over.”</p><p>In setting out to explore what Faulkner can tell us about the Civil War and what the war can tell us about Faulkner, Gorra engages as both historian and literary critic. But he also writes, he confesses, as an “act of citizenship.” His book represents his own meditation on the meaning of the “forever war” of race, not just in American history and literature, but in our fraught time. What we think today about the Civil War, he believes, “serves above all to tell us what we think about ourselves, about the nature of our polity and the shape of our history.”</p><p>The core of Gorra’s book is a Civil War narrative, which he has created by untangling the war’s appearances throughout Faulkner’s fiction and rearranging them “into something like linearity.” From the layers and circularities and recurrences and reversals of Faulkner’s 19 novels and more than 100 short stories, Gorra has constructed a chronological telling of Yoknapatawpha’s war, of the incidents and characters who appear in the writer’s extended chronicle of his invented “postage stamp” world. Faulkner took liberties with the historical order of events; what he sought to depict was the “psychological truth of the Confederate home front” and the war’s aftermath. This is work, Gorra argues, that actual documents of the period would be hard-pressed to do. And that psychological truth certainly could not have been derived from study of the racist historiography of Faulkner’s era, which he insisted he never even read. Instead, this understanding is the product of what Toni Morrison once called Faulkner’s “refusal-to-look-away approach” to the burden of his region’s cruel past.</p><p>Faulkner enacts this refusal through his practice of looking again, of revisiting the same characters and stories, and through the prequels and sequels and outgrowths of those he has already told, digging deeply into the hidden and often shocking truths of the South he portrays. Gorra endeavors to unknot and clarify Faulkner’s oeuvre by reconstructing it himself, but his act of literary explication is also one of participation—a joining in the Faulknerian process. Gorra renarrates these Civil War stories as he seeks to come to terms both with America’s painful racial legacies and with William Faulkner.</p><p>Perhaps the most powerful of Faulkner’s tellings of the Civil War story is Absalom, Absalom! (1936), a novel structured around Quentin Compson’s own refusal to look away. Although Faulkner insisted that Quentin did not speak for him, Gorra has “never quite believed him.” Quentin’s search to understand why Charles Bon was murdered during the very last days of the war unfolds through his elaboration of successive narratives in a manner not unlike Faulkner’s own. Unsatisfied with each version of the story he uncovers, Quentin looks again, arriving through ever more disturbing revelations at the South’s original sin: the distorting and dehumanizing power of race. It is race that pulls the trigger. “So it’s the miscegenation, not the incest, which you cant bear,” Bon says just before Henry, at once his brother and his fiancée’s brother, shoots him.</p><p>To think of this novel appearing in the same year as Gone With the Wind is startling. It was moonlight and magnolias, rather than a searing portrait of the persisting legacies of slavery, that captured the public’s acclaim: Margaret Mitchell, not Faulkner, won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1937. But Faulkner’s period of “explosive productivity,” beginning in 1929—13 books in 13 years—attracted a different sort of attention, because of his formal innovations and literary experimentalism, not just his unvarnished portrayals of race. In a 1939 essay, Jean-Paul Sartre compared him to Proust, and Faulkner became an idol in the eyes of young French intellectuals as well as literary critics around the world. Faulkner might not have won the Pulitzer, but he was on the path to his 1949 Nobel.</p><p>Gorra notes the “ever-increasing importance of race” in Faulkner’s fiction. Yet society’s racial attitudes and practices were evolving even more rapidly than Faulkner’s own. As the civil-rights movement gained momentum after the end of World War II, Faulkner engaged in more explicit public commentary about America’s divisions and inequities. Like critics in those years and ever since, Gorra struggles to come to terms with the distressing views Faulkner frequently articulated on questions of racial progress and racial justice. Gorra does not look away from Faulkner’s troubling public statements or from some disconcerting stereotypes and assumptions in his literary work that became newly jarring as social attitudes shifted.</p><p>A great deal is at stake in Gorra’s effort. We are in a time when authors’ reputations are overturned, their works removed from reading lists, their achievements devalued because of their blindness on questions we now see with different eyes. At the outset of his book, Gorra reminds us of persisting debates over Joseph Conrad, initially stimulated by a 1977 Chinua Achebe essay labeling him an apologist for imperialism. Today, Gorra believes, Faulkner “stands to us as Conrad does,” in need of reexamination and an updated understanding that confronts his racist shortcomings.</p><p>Faulkner, Gorra concedes, “remained a white man of the Jim Crow South and did not always rise above it. At times his words both can and should make us uncomfortable.” His fiction offers an “all-too forgiving depiction of slaveholder paternalism.” His novels and stories fail to render slavery’s physical cruelties; they include no depiction of an auction, a family separated by sale, or a whipping. Many of his Black characters seem incomplete, although they’re certainly not the caricatured stereotypes typical of so much white southern writing of his time. Faulkner remarked upon white men who had “the courage and endurance to resist … Reconstruction.” The Unvanquished presents John Sartoris as a leader of the local Klan admirably determined to keep “the carpetbaggers from organizing the negroes into an insurrection,” which was Sartoris’s view of the Black claim on the franchise. As Gorra observes, Faulkner’s “picture of black voters as inevitably ignorant and corruptible simply parrots the view of Reconstruction that was current in Faulkner’s childhood and for some decades thereafter.” A 1943 short story Faulkner wrote for The Saturday Evening Post presents the slave broker and Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest in a generous manner that Gorra finds particularly “hard to stomach.” At the same time, Gorra points out, the depiction of enslaved people fleeing to freedom and securing their own emancipation transcends the historiography of Faulkner’s time and anticipates that of our own. He is no apologist for the Old South, and resists in any way glorifying the war, unlike almost every other white southerner of his era.</p><p>The public pronouncements Faulkner made on race as the civil-rights movement unfolded are in many ways even more disturbing than the shortcomings Gorra identifies in his fiction. In an appalling drunken interview with the British Sunday Times in 1956, Faulkner invoked the specter of race war if the South were compelled to integrate, but when his words were widely reviled, he denied ever having uttered them. He regularly spoke out against lynching and deplored the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, saying that any society that murdered children didn’t “deserve to survive, and probably won’t.” But he had once suggested that mobs, “like our juries … have a way of being right.” Gorra underscores the “incoherence” of Faulkner’s position as both critic and defender of the white South’s resistance to change.</p><p>In many ways, he was a quintessential white southern “moderate,” an identity much scrutinized as the civil-rights movement gathered momentum. He condemned violence and recognized the need to end segregation, but he rejected what Martin Luther King Jr. later described as “the fierce urgency of now.” Indeed, it was the moral failures of just such moderates that King would directly assail in his 1963 “Letter From Birmingham Jail.” Faulkner urged patience and delay and spoke out against federal coercion of the white South. His critics thought he should have known better. As James Baldwin explained in a 1956 essay condemning his views on desegregation, Faulkner hoped to give southern whites the time and opportunity to save themselves, to reclaim their moral identity. But their salvation could come, if at all, only at the cost of postponing justice for Black Americans, which Baldwin made clear was no longer conceivable.</p><p>Gorra assembles quite a bill of failings, especially if we view Faulkner with the assumptions of our time and place rather than his own. Yet having meticulously acknowledged all of this, Gorra makes his claim for Faulkner the writer by reproving Faulkner the man. “When writing fiction,” Faulkner “became better than he was.” He had, Gorra argues, an uncanny ability to “think his way within other people,” to inhabit their being so as to erase preconceptions and prejudices in the very act of portraying their minds and souls. Through fiction, Faulkner could “stand outside his Oxford, his Jefferson, and see the behavior his people take for granted, the things they don’t even question.” As Gorra presents it, the act of writing bestowed an almost mystical clear-sightedness. Yet that clarity was always challenged in the fetid Mississippi air that Faulkner, like all his characters, had to breathe. And it is that very tension, the combination of the flaws and the brilliance, that for Gorra makes his case.</p><p>Is this rendering of Faulkner’s weaknesses as the source of his strength just an act of interpretive jiu‑jitsu? Or perhaps a reversion to a romantic notion of redemptive genius? Or is Gorra influenced by what Faulkner himself urged upon posterity: that his life be “abolished and voided from history,” leaving only “the printed books”? After all, Faulkner once declared that he wanted his epitaph to read “He made the books and he died.”</p><p>But Gorra insists on the importance of the teller and the tale, as well as on the creative force Faulkner derived from the burden of race, which he could not escape. It is because of, not in spite of, Faulkner’s shortcomings that we must continue to engage with his work: These failures are product and emblem of the legacies of racial injustice that shape us all. In his Nobel Prize speech in 1950, Faulkner declared that the only thing worth writing about was “the human heart in conflict with itself.” He lived that conflict even as he wrote about it. His struggles forced him to experiment and to innovate, yielding both his aesthetic and his ethical insight. These very difficulties—“the drama and … power of his attempt to work through our history, to wrestle or rescue it into meaning”—are what make Faulkner so worthwhile. We read him because he takes us with him into our national heart of darkness, into the shameful history we have still failed to confront or understand. Our past, Gorra and Faulkner agree, is “never over.” Or certainly not yet.</p><p>We want to hear what you think about this article.

  "content": "<p>Joseph​ Banks owed his fortune to land and his celebrity to the sea. Born in 1743 to a wealthy landowning family, he was sketchily educated at Harrow, Eton and Oxford. His father died when he was 18, and he came into his inheritance three years later, living for the rest of his life off the rents from large estates in the Lincolnshire fens, Derbyshire and Staffordshire. Banks had about £6000 a year when he started out, and, through aggressive fen-draining, enclosure, improvements in sheep husbandry, and a prudential marriage in 1779 to an heiress with holdings in Kent, was worth £30,000 per annum at his death in 1820. That made him one of the richest men in England; he could do what he liked; and what he liked to do was to travel and collect.</p><p>The usual late 18th-century itinerary for polite travelling and collecting was the Grand Tour, but the young Banks had a different idea. (‘Every blockhead does that,’ he said. ‘My grand tour shall be one round the whole globe.’) At Eton, he had discovered a love of botany (as one does). He followed Linnaeus’s new programme of systematic classification; and he looked for ways to spend a lot of time exploring and collecting plants. Around 1766, an opportunity presented itself that would allow Banks to combine heroic natural history with the most unusual and grandest of all tours. The Royal Society was lobbying the Admiralty to send a ship to reach the South Seas in 1769, in order to observe the Transit of Venus, the passage of the planet across the face of the Sun. Competent observation of this event would enable accurate determination of the distance between the Earth and the Sun, and of the size of the solar system. There would not be another Transit of Venus until 1874. The navy agreed that the voyage would be worthwhile (the measurements would help with map-making), and it emerged that there was a secret government plan to find out whether the long-speculated Terra Australis Incognita – the great undiscovered Southern continent – really existed; if it did, to take possession in the name of King George III; and if it didn’t, to plant the flag on whatever still unknown lands were encountered in the circumnavigation.</p><p>The Royal Society would organise the astronomy, securing a grant from the king to pay for it; the navy would be responsible for the ship, commander, crew, stores and victualling. The vessel was the bark Endeavour; the commander was the bluff, 39-year-old Yorkshireman James Cook, who was also an able astronomer. No one had thought to add natural history to the workload, but Banks got wind of the plan and thrust himself forward. He secured his place on the Endeavour by pulling strings – Lord Sandwich, a former first lord of the Admiralty, was a friend, a fishing companion and Fenlands neighbour – and by spreading money about. Banks’s personal paid-for entourage for the voyage included the talented Swedish botanist Daniel Solander; a Finnish draughtsman and cataloguer; two artists (to make drawings and paintings of specimens and landscapes); and four servants from his Lincolnshire estate (two of them black). His luggage included a pair of greyhounds, a dog and a bitch called Lady (for hunting); a skiff (for netting marine specimens); a vast quantity of paper (for dried plants); glass cases, boxes and bottles; high-end optical instruments; fishing nets and tackle; a small arsenal of pistols, rifles, shotguns and ammunition (for sport and science); and supplementary food and drink up to gentlemanly standards – beer, porter, wine, apple pies, an excellent Cheshire cheese. The sum Banks laid out for salaries, supplies and kit was enormous – perhaps between £6000 and £10,000 – about £2 million in current money. He always travelled in style. On a later – and much shorter – jaunt to Iceland, Banks assembled a team of 17, including three liveried servants, a Malay he had brought back from the Endeavour voyage, a gardener, a French chef and two French horn players. A new set of Wedgwood Queen’s Ware china was packed for onshore entertainment.</p><p>During the three years of the Endeavour’s voyage, planting the flag and tagging the plants co-existed. The Transit of Venus was observed in Tahiti on 3 June 1769. The mathematically challenged Banks had little part in the observation, though an engraving produced later was captioned: ‘Mr Banks shows the Indians the Planet Venus on the Sun.’ Islands west of Tahiti were mapped and claimed for the Crown; later, Aotearoa (‘New Zealand’ to the pakeha) and the east coast of Australia were added to the imperial inventory (the naming of ‘Botany Bay’ indexed the joined-up enterprises of natural history and empire-building). The tropical botanising was everything Banks had hoped for. He returned to London with a haul of more than thirty thousand plant specimens, many then unknown to European science, and a thousand – less successfully preserved – fish, birds, molluscs, insects and other animals. What later came to be called ethnographic materials were also haphazardly collected: cartloads of cloaks, weapons, utensils and assorted ‘rarities’, picked up all along the way from Tierra del Fuego to the Indian Ocean.</p><p>There was very often a scientific purpose to the collecting – it’s always good to find new species – but there is no missing the sheer delight Banks took in going about it. Banksian collecting involved tramping, climbing, shooting and fishing. He was a plant hunter as much as he was a collector. Later in life, Banks would get fat and gouty, but in his twenties he was a fit and active sportsman. He also collected people. Departing Tahiti, he took onboard the Tahitian Tupaia and his young companion Tayeto. Tupaia was a highly skilled open-sea navigator, an invaluable Polynesian go-between, and the kind of man whom Banks recognised as the local version of a gent – ‘certainly a most proper man, well born’. Cook didn’t want him on board, but Banks decided to take him at his own expense. ‘Thank Heaven,’ Banks wrote in his journal, ‘I have a sufficiency, and I do not know why I may not keep him as a curiosity as well as my neighbours do lions and tygers at a larger expence than he will ever probably put me to.’ In the event, his Tahitian curiosities didn’t make it back to Britain; they both died of malaria in the East Indies.</p><p>In 1774 another British voyage to the South Seas returned with a striking Ra’iātean called Mai (known to the English as ‘Omai’). Banks introduced him to London society, and he soon became a must-see metropolitan attraction. Joshua Reynolds painted his portrait and William Parry did an ensemble piece of Mai, Solander and Banks. Mai met the king, Dr Johnson and Fanny Burney; a play about him was performed at the Theatre Royal; he learned to play chess and backgammon, and many agreed with Mrs Thrale’s comment about the ‘savage’s good breeding’. Banks delighted in showing him off: an aristocratic friend commented that Banks seemed ‘to keep him as an object of curiosity, to observe the workings of an untutored, unenlightened mind’. Mai indicated that he would like to learn to write, but Banks made no effort to oblige him. After Mai returned home, Banks carefully reclaimed his hospitality costs from the government: £317 11s 11½d.</p><p>When Banks returned to London in 1771, he was a very great celebrity. He had been around the world and brought much of it home, where you could ask permission to see it at his house in Soho Square. Within months of his return, his uncle commissioned two fine portraits. The American expat Benjamin West painted him wearing a splendid Māori flax cloak, standing among a striking assortment of South Sea trophies, and his friend Joshua Reynolds underlined the point by posing the romantically unwigged young Banks with a globe and a seascape in the distant background. His left hand rests on a pile of letters, the uppermost bearing an inscription from Horace: ‘Cras Ingens Iterabimus Aequor’ (‘Tomorrow we’ll sail the vasty deep once more’). Everybody wanted to meet Banks; everybody wanted to see the spoils of his voyage. He had been elected to the Royal Society even before the Endeavour voyage and now he was admitted to its inner circles. There were sparkling dinner parties; he became a member of the taste-defining Society of Dilettanti and the Society of Antiquaries; and he was presented to the king, soon becoming a royal favourite and trusted adviser to the agriculturally obsessed ‘Farmer George’.</p><p>Banks came back a cad as well as a hero. Botany in the Linnaean mode was already considered a louche science in the late 18th century – all that unwholesome prying into the sex lives of plants – and the Encyclopaedia Britannica announced that ‘obscenity is the very basis of the Linnaean system.’ London satirists drew cartoons of Banks as a foppishly affected ‘Botanic Macaroni’ and as ‘The Fly Catching Macaroni’, while Gillray produced ‘The Great South Sea Caterpillar, Transform’d Into a Bath Butterfly’. But Banks brought a special frisson to the figure of the botanising voyager. There was talk in London about the obligingness of Tahitian women and about Banks’s sporting ways, which his Journal did little to deny, bragging that ‘he had tasted Womans flesh in almost every part of the Known habitable World.’ Later, he reported that in Tahiti ‘Love is the chief occupation’ and that ‘Both the bodies and souls of the women are moulded in the utmost perfection for that soft science.’ London wits responded with ribald satire. One series spoofed his presumed relationship with the queen of Tahiti – though his Journal insisted that he much preferred her younger companion – and the anonymous poem ‘Mimosa’, dedicated to Banks, played on the idea of his ‘sensitive plant’, growing in stature in tropical conditions: ‘The plains of Otaheité … rear this plant to an amazing height’:</p><p>The historical career of the notion of the natural-living, free-loving, noble savage passes through Tahiti, from Rousseau by way of Banks and the besotted crew of HMS Bounty to Paul Gauguin.</p><p>And there were much gossiped about passages of dodgy behaviour on home soil. Departing on the voyage to the South Seas, Banks left behind a young lady, Harriet Blosset, so convinced he had made a promise to marry that she spent three years knitting waistcoats for him. On his return, Banks did not hurry to see her and, her family inquiring what was up, explained that he didn’t feel quite ready for marriage. He apparently settled on the unhappy Blossets a sum rumoured to be about £5000 – plus reimbursement for waistcoat materials. The bad behaviour persisted. Before his marriage to the heiress, there was at least one long-term mistress, an unacknowledged child, and a string of casual engagements with prostitutes patronised by other members of the libertine Hellfire Club. In 1776, David Hume reported that Banks and Sandwich had gone fishing, joined by ‘two or three Ladies of pleasure’. Everybody knew this sort of thing about Banks, and there’s no evidence that he much minded the satires or that they did him any damage. Wealth has its privileges.</p><p>Banks was chronically seasick, but he was keen nonetheless on a repeat performance, lobbying to join Cook’s second expedition to the South Seas in 1772. Full of himself, he pushed hard for upgraded accommodations, an even larger entourage and bulkier baggage. This time, he pushed too hard: the Admiralty baulked, and Cook left without him, stopping at Madeira to pick up a travelling companion Banks had arranged to meet there. The companion – identified as a ‘Mr Burnett’ – was surprised that Banks wasn’t onboard, and Cook too was surprised, straightfacedly judging that ‘Every part of Mr Burnett’s behaviour and every action tended to prove that he was a Woman’ – as it happened, one of Banks’s mistresses, who then had to beat a retreat back to England. Apart from a hastily arranged expedition to Iceland and a trip to the Netherlands, Banks remained on land for the rest of his life.</p><p>The​ period immediately following his return from the circumnavigation was the great inflection point of Banks’s career. Toby Musgrave, in his new biography, marks that point by telling the story differently before and after. From Banks’s birth to his return on the Endeavour, the mode is chronological and the manner is heroic narrative. Afterwards, the story is thematically organised – accounts of the various projects in which ‘the multifarious Mr Banks’ was involved and the institutions with which he was associated until his death in 1820. That seems about right. Banks was 29 years old when he left off voyaging, and the rest of his life was something very different from what it had been.</p><p>Banks’s life and works have been well documented. (Musgrave says that he is ‘a curiously neglected figure in his native country’, but that’s not quite true.) There was a thorough biography in 1988 by the scientist Harold Carter; Patrick O’Brian’s Life, published a year earlier, was a well-researched and ripping yarn, as you’d expect from the author of the ‘Aubrey/Maturin’ romans fleuves, in which a character based on Banks appears; two excellent accounts from the 1990s by the historian John Gascoigne situated Banks in the context of the English Enlightenment and the empire; Neil Chambers in 2007 contextualised Banks in the history of collecting; Patricia Fara has a rollicking go at Banks as an exploitative imperialist in Sex, Botany and Empire (2003); Banks gets a chapter to himself in Richard Holmes’s much praised The Age of Wonder: How the Romantic Generation Discovered the Beauty and Terror of Science (2008); and there is another shelf-full of standard biographies and popular treatments going back to the 19th century. As well as biography, there are accounts of Banks’s expeditions, his administrative and institution-building roles, his activities as an improving landowner and as a Crown servant.</p><p>The Australians have kept Banks (and Cook) close to the centre of their historical sensibilities. If history had taken a slightly different turn, the Lucky Country (and not just the plant genus) could have been known as ‘Banksia’ – a suggestion seriously made by Linnaeus’s son. There has been a Royal Society conference devoted to him, and recently he has been a focus of wide-ranging academic discussions about the importance of writing the history of globalised science, of exchange relationships, and of the development of connections between science, commerce and statecraft. The many followers of Bruno Latour recruit him to illustrate the notions of ‘cycles of accumulation’, ‘centres of calculation’, the global circulation of ‘immutable mobiles’ – maps, charts, paper representations of plants and animals – and the extension of power by collapsing the distant world to the dimensions of a table-top.</p><p>Musgrave comes to Banks from a background in garden design and garden history, and his book’s centre of gravity is Banks’s role in plant collection, exchange and transplantation. What The Multifarious Mr Banks lacks in pizzazz and historiographic ambition it makes up for in detail, enthusiastic admiration of its subject and commitment to repairing a calumny-damaged reputation. It relates exactly how many species Banks collected at each point in his travels and from those whose travels he later sponsored, how many of these were hitherto unknown, how many proved to be ‘type specimens’, how much Banks laid out (to the shilling) in supporting his network of plant hunters, the – actually, quite fascinating – techniques he devised for getting potted plants from one end of the Earth to another, and, despite his best efforts, how frustratingly often everything was lost. (Moving paper representations around the world was hard; moving seeds and, especially, living plants was infinitely harder. Even bringing back dried plant specimens wasn’t easy: Banks and Solander brought along bulk quantities of printers’ waste proofs of Addison’s Notes on ‘Paradise Lost’, preserving plant samples between its loosely bound pages.)</p><p>Against the charge that Banks had unpleasant racial views, Musgrave offers a range of defences: Banks had, on the whole, sympathetic relations with native people (he was fascinated by tattooing and almost certainly got himself tattooed on Tahiti); he was, Musgrave says, a sympathetic ‘ethnographer’, who gave a ‘detailed anthropological account’ of Polynesians; the occasional shootings of Tahitians, Māori and Australian aboriginal people were the result of ‘misunderstandings’ and ‘cultural differences’, unfortunate accidents, some of which the diplomatic Banks tried to prevent; when he himself was compelled to use ‘lethal force’ against the natives, he felt bad about it, being ‘a compassionate man with a strong moral conscience’; the reason for his commitment to colonisation was basically ‘philanthropic’; and the disastrous effects of contact between Europeans and native people – about which Musgrave has only the barest minimum to say – are, in the event, not to be held against any individual.</p><p>In some of these defences, Musgrave has a point: there’s little reason to think that Banks was worse, in certain respects, than the European average. Some of the others, however, are a stretch. In pressing hard for penal settlements in Australia, he claimed that the land was ‘thinly peopled’ by an ‘extremely cowardly’ population of a ‘timid Disposition’; their interests and concerns were not elsewhere considered. Musgrave concedes that Banks’s remark about keeping Tupaia as a pet and ‘curiosity’ was ‘crass’, ‘culturally insensitive’ and (as we now say) ‘inappropriate’, but adds that this was just the way many ‘upper-class British males’ then thought about ‘a remote island culture’. Banks evidently believed that slavery was a bad idea, but the arguments against it did not rest, he insisted, on moral or religious principles, ‘which are in my opinion incapable of being maintaind in argument, but on Commercial ones which weigh equaly in moral & in immoral minds’. Slavery would eventually die a natural death on economic grounds, though Banks reckoned that it persisted because black people were ‘endowed with a much less proportion of mental vigor than the whites’; they would work only when coerced; and, anyway, a slave well treated is happier than a free person with a ‘choice only of bad masters or none’.</p><p>‘When at sea, sail; when on land, settle,’ the proverb has it, but, his travels finished, what would Banks settle down to do? He would arrange and house his collections; he would preside over the London residence where the objects now lived and manage access to them; he would correspond extensively with interested parties, sometimes writing fifty letters a day; he would improve his Lincolnshire estates and increase the rents; and he would marry someone suitable. But along the way, he would figure out how to turn his networks, and his financial and material assets, into a way of life that spanned the globe, that built and expanded imperial power.</p><p>Banks’s London life and his global reach were shaped by the metropolitan institutions he influenced or controlled. After his return from the South Seas, and then Iceland in 1773, Banks said that ‘I livd in no particular station till … I was elected President of the Royal Society.’ He had made known his interest in the position; he secured it in 1778, aged just 35; and he ruled for the next 42 years – the longest serving president ever. ‘Banks was not a leading scientist,’ Musgrave writes; indeed, you could say that he was not a ‘scientist’ at all. He knew a lot about plants and animals, but he published little; his much awaited Florilegium – a picture book of plants collected on the Endeavour expedition – was continually promised and continually put off, the British Museum producing a complete edition only in 1990 (an affordable selection appeared in 2017). Musgrave gently scolds Banks for his ‘deplorable failure’ to complete botanical projects and to publish results. He never wrote anything in the Royal Society’s Philosophical Transactions, but the fellows knew what they were doing when they elected him. A French flatterer said that Banks was an academy all by himself, but the relevant point isn’t how much knowledge Banks had but how many knowledgeable people he knew and knew how to recruit. He was a great fixer, an enabler, a patron, a networker, an organiser and an administrator.</p><p>His Endeavour celebrity was cash in the bank for that career; he was in correspondence with a worldwide web of naturalists; he was generous with his own funds; and he was extremely well connected at court. (Banks successfully lobbied for a baronetcy after securing the Royal Society presidency; in 1795, the king insisted that he become a knight of the Order of the Bath, the red sash of which he delighted in wearing when taking the Royal Society chair; and in 1797, he entered the inner circle of Crown advisers as a privy councillor.) He left behind a trail of acrimony over his despotic tendencies, and resentment from physicists and mathematicians about undue influence by amateurs, mediocrities, utilitarians and ‘Macaronis’. But his regime effected long-lasting ties binding all sorts of science to state power. When he died, an obituary observed that Banks had given ‘science a home in the courts of greatness’.</p><p>Banks exchanged youthful adventure for project management, a life of excitement for one of worldwide consequence. The big project was mercantilist imperialism. A species of economic importance was discovered in one part of the world, then brought back to the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, the powerplant at the centre of a growing network of colonial botanic gardens, of which Banks was the de facto director. If an exotic plant could thrive in Britain, that was good, but if it couldn’t, the plant might be moved to other parts of the far-flung empire and its products imported to the home islands. Botany would do as much as any other science to make Britain Great. New Zealand flax could become a source of naval cordage and Australasian timber could be turned into naval masts; grapevines and citrus trees could be moved from Europe to New South Wales, making the colony self-sufficient or even a source of supply for Britain; seeds from Peruvian cinchona trees could be grown in British India to ensure a steady supply of quinine, with which to fight malaria. Banks thought up one of the earliest British plots to steal tea plants, and abduct skilled tea-workers, from China and ship them to British Assam where an imperial tea industry could be started up and the drain of silver from the Exchequer to China plugged.</p><p>The most celebrated instance of Banksian imperial botany was the large-scale transfer of Tahitian breadfruit trees to the West Indies, there to feed plantation slaves more efficiently and at lower cost than the plantain and yam diet they were used to. Captain Bligh sailed off to Tahiti in the Bounty, where the crew were predictably enchanted and yearned to stay on. Bligh heroically survived the mutiny, but the breadfruit trees – thrown overboard – did not. Undeterred, Banks pressed for a second expedition and the Tahitian trees were successfully delivered to Jamaica and St Vincent, where they flourished – though the slaves found the taste unpleasant.</p><p>Some of Banks’s projects to change political and economic realities by moving living things around the world were striking successes. He arranged for the theft of fine-wool Merino sheep from Spain: the result transformed Britain’s flock and laid the foundations for the huge Australian sheep industry. Other projects bore fruit only after his death, and some never came to anything. But the intentions became institutions of scientific statecraft and the global transfer of living things did indeed ‘shape the world’. A friend once flattered Banks: ‘Wide as the world is, traces of you are to be found in every corner of it.’ Some of those traces are Banks-branded places, geographical features, plants – towns in Australia, islands in the South Pacific and Canada, mountains, headlands, peninsulas, bodies of water, 173 species of the Banksia genus, which once grew only in Australia but are now in domestic gardens all over the world, and the ‘Big Bad Banksia Men’ of May Gibbs’s children’s books, which have infiltrated the ids of generations of Australians. Global Banks marks the extent of once global Britain. The man himself lies in an unmarked grave – which he requested – in a church under the flight path to Heathrow. And the definitive Chantrey-sculpted statue stands in the Natural History Museum in South Kensington – where it belongs, and where it’s safe.</p>",

  "content": "<p>My parents were married at six o’clock on Sunday evening, October 25, 1936, at the Quincy Manor in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, and a week or so later, they began clipping coupons from the front page of The New York Post, one coupon a day, and mailing them to the Post, twenty-four coupons at a time, which coupons, along with ninety-three cents, brought them four volumes of a twenty-volume set of The Complete Works of Charles Dickens, a set that, with full-page illustrations, was printed from plates Harper & Brothers had used for older, more expensive sets. The Post’s promotion began in January 1936 and expired on May 16, 1938, two weeks before I was born. And when, eighty-two years later, in the week of June 9, 2020—a week that marked the 150th anniversary of Dickens’s death—I was isolated in my New York City apartment due to the Covid-19 lockdown, it occurred to me that this might be a good time to do what I’d often thought of doing: reread all of Dickens.</p><p>The Post was the first newspaper in the United States to offer complete sets of Dickens. This kind of marketing campaign, whose primary purpose was to increase circulation, was known as a “continuity” program, and it originated in England, where a young Englishman, John Stevenson, had used similar promotional methods to help increase the circulation of the London Daily Herald from 350,000 to over a million within a year. In 1936, when he was twenty years old, Stevenson came to New York and worked for The Post. After a spell there, he went on to work for newspapers and department stores in a wide range of cities, including Boston, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Syracuse, and would distribute millions of books, including complete sets of works by Shakespeare, Robert Louis Stevenson, Mark Twain, Honoré de Balzac, Victor Hugo, and Joseph Conrad.</p><p>One evening at the beginning of the pandemic lockdown in March, after watching Great Expectations on Turner Classic Movies—the 1946 version, directed by David Lean—I took down my parents’ copy of Great Expectations and found, tucked between the last page and the back cover, a letter addressed to “Dear Reader” from the “Dickens Presentation Department” of The New York Post. “Congratulations!” the letter began:</p><p>With the four volumes you have just received you now own MORE THAN HALF of your 20-volume set of the Complete Works of Charles Dickens. And you certainly have every reason to feel especially happy about it. But just stop and think what an imposing array of beautiful volumes you will have on your library shelves when you have placed the last eight volumes beside the twelve volumes you now own!</p><p>The four volumes were “among the most important works that Dickens wrote,” the letter continued, after which it gave brief descriptions of each book (Nicholas Nickleby “presents a vivid picture of family life in which love and romance are interwoven with black treachery”), and noted that “the next four volumes now on press are ‘Bleak House,’ ‘Dombey and Son,’ ‘A Child’s History of England,’ and ‘Uncommercial Traveler’… these celebrated works of Dickens described on the other side of this page.” Here, for example, the description of Dombey and Son, a novel with descriptions of a childhood in which the cruelty of parents mark a young boy’s life forever:</p><p>This great novel may be briefly described as the rise, fall and decay of the House of Dombey. It is a tragic tale of a delicate and sensitive boy crushed by the brutal selfishness of his father. Among the things longest remembered in “Dombey and Son” are the tenderly drawn pictures of little Paul… In none of his writings is his deep sympathy for childhood more perfectly expressed than in this great book. The lonely, misunderstood Paul Dombey and his sister Florence take their places beside David Copperfield, Oliver Twist and Little Nell as children who will live in our hearts always.</p><p>“Here is a library you will treasure not merely today or just tomorrow, but for all time,” the letter ended. “You will own volumes that will distinguish any room and constantly serve as a reflection of your own discriminating taste.”</p><p>There was also a description of Our Mutual Friend in another “Dear Reader” letter, in words lifted mostly from Dickens’s first chapter. This was a novel I would first read when I was twenty; though set in a different time and place, it would, like Dombey and Son, vividly conjure up the often mad elements that coursed through my own family as they did through the life of the twenty-year-old heroine of Dickens’s novel, Lizzie Hexam:</p><p>A sinister bird of prey seemed Jesse Hexam, crouched in the stern of a dirty row boat, his eyes fixed upon the broad waters of the Thames, his arms bare, his shirt matted, his clothes mud-begrimed. Twilight deepened the shadows cast by the huddled buildings of London, but his gaze did not swerve. His daughter, a girl of twenty, rowing in obedience to his nods, regarded him with fascinated dread. Suddenly he stiffened; the bird of prey had sighted the quarry. A few minutes later behind the boat a body bobbed and lunged. Hexam had found another corpse, the pockets of another drowned man to rifle. It was this grisly livelihood that was reflected in the frightened eyes of Lizzie Hexam.</p><p>Throughout my childhood, The Complete Works of Charles Dickens resided behind a glass-enclosed side panel of a mahogany breakfront in the living room of our 730-square-foot Brooklyn apartment. The breakfront, about four and a half feet wide and seven feet high, dominated our small living room, and was filled with my parents’ most precious possessions—Jewish ritual objects, wine glasses, vases, serving dishes, and, in the central glass-fronted cabinet, a half-dozen sets of delicate gold-rimmed demitasse cups and saucers of a kind virtually all my aunts displayed in their breakfronts and china closets.</p><p>Before I entered kindergarten, and before my only sibling, Robert, was born—he and I were five years apart—my mother sat me down in our living room one afternoon for what she said was going to be “a special occasion.” She unlocked a side panel of the breakfront, took down Great Expectations, and taught me how to open it in a way that would not “break” its binding or “crack” its spine. She asked me to read the book’s opening paragraph aloud to her, which I did, surprised to discover that the main character in a “great” novel had a name as simple as “Pip” (and told the reader so in a sentence I’ve carried with me ever since: “So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip”). After that—just the two of us in a moment more peaceful than most I would ever experience with her, and like a movie star—my mother adored being the center of attention, a place she commanded wherever she went by her exceptional beauty and flair for the dramatic—she read and acted out several pages of the novel.</p><p>This memory connects to a more familiar one: watching my father, who was totally blind in one eye and legally blind in the other, sitting in front of the breakfront and shielding his good eye from the glare of a stand-up lamp’s light while, at a drop-down secretary contained in the breakfront’s top drawer, he paid bills and worked at his accounts. The secretary had slots for storing bills and letters, cubbyholes and drawers for supplies, and a pale green blotter held in place at its four corners by leather triangles into which my father tucked notes and bills.</p><p>Despite his weak vision—his literally cockeyed gaze forever recalling for me the description in Dombey and Son of Jack Bunsby, who had “one stationary eye in [his] mahogany face, and one revolving one, on the principle of some lighthouses”—my father was in the printing business; more exactly, he was what was then called a printing “jobber.” Beginning when I was eight or nine years old, and continuing through my high school years, I would often, on school vacations, go to work with my father, whose “office” was a desk he rented in one of the offices of a printing company on Sullivan Street in Greenwich Village. I would spend the days either going to clients and print shops with him or—my great joy—traveling the subways on my own and picking up orders such as personal stationery, invitations, and circulars from print shops that I either brought to him or delivered for him.</p><p>At home, and with a patience he rarely showed at other times, he would sometimes explain what he was doing and why, and I would be astonished that a man who was nearly blind could, and in such a narrow space—the breakfront’s desk was less than six inches deep—not only read the miniscule print in catalogues, but write out, in elegant script, and with bold, clear ruled lines and symbols (for invoices, receipts, order forms)—the “copy” that he (or I) would bring to printing shops where his handwritten and hand-drawn pages would be transformed into stacks of printed matter.</p><p>Other than the time my mother and I read to each other from the opening pages of Great Expectations, I don’t recall ever seeing my father or mother actually reading a book of Dickens, and yet, in memory, our family life—a mid-twentieth-century Brooklyn world determined by difficult economic circumstances, inhabited by eccentric, larger-than-life characters, rooted in family feuds about inheritance and money, and steeped in scenes of intense, high drama—seems distinctly Dickensian.</p><p>While my father worked at his desk, my mother would, most evenings, find an occasion to go on rants—screaming, sobbing, occasionally banging her head against a wall—about how small and suffocating our apartment was, and about how hard she worked while he “dabbled” at accounts that were never going to pay the rent. On Saturday afternoons, after he came home from synagogue, the rants would become more ferocious. “Look at him—!” she’d cry. “Just look at him, would you?—just look at the way he sits there in the dark doing nothing!”</p><p>Our father’s printing business was “a sickness,” she’d declare, and she’d plead with him to shut it down, to file for bankruptcy, and to get a real job—so that she, a registered nurse who’d finished first in her class at nursing school, could stop working nights and sixteen-hour double-shifts at hospitals while also taking on part-time secretarial jobs, directing fundraising campaigns for charities, caring for me and Robert, and still doing all the housekeeping chores that women who did not have to work at full-time jobs performed: shopping, cooking, ironing, sewing, cleaning, etc.</p><p>My father would respond by saying that the only thing he hoped for in this life—“Above all, Annie!” he’d cry. “Above all!”—was to be able to do well enough so that she could stop working and our family could afford to move to a larger apartment. And he would proclaim his undying love for her, and declare that he was the luckiest man in the world and one of the smartest—and how did he know this, he’d say—because he’d had the good sense to marry “the most wonderful and beautiful woman in the world!”</p><p>To his constant protestations of love, she’d reply, dismissively, “I know you love me,” much in the manner, I’d later think, that David Copperfield’s Emma Micawber repeatedly says of her husband, incarcerated for not having paid his creditors, “I will never desert Micawber.”</p><p>In fact, our mother regularly threatened to leave our father. When they thought we were asleep, Robert and I would hear them arguing in the kitchen about getting a divorce, with—the usual script—my mother saying she would “take” Robert and my father could “have” me. Like many couples of their generation who had embattled marriages, our parents stayed together—“stuck it out,” in the idiom of the times—though every few months our mother would leave us with our father and go on weekend getaways to mysterious places called “milk farms” (Did they milk cows, Robert and I wondered. Drink milk? Bathe in milk?). And, once every few years, usually when a family for which she did at-home nursing gave her a cash bonus, she would take cross-country trips, by train, to Los Angeles, where she would stay with cousins for several weeks. Sometimes, too, our father would leave us with our mother, depart for work in the morning with a small suitcase, and stay for several days and nights with the families of one of his brothers or sisters.</p><p>Our father, born on New York City’s Lower East Side in 1904, was one of nine children (six older brothers and sisters were born in Poland), and our mother, born in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn in 1911, was one of eight (two boys had died, also in Poland, before the family immigrated to the United States). As a result, Robert and I had thirty-seven first cousins, all of whom—except for the son and daughter of an aunt and uncle who had moved to what I thought of as a foreign country, the Bronx—lived in Brooklyn, most of them within walking distance.</p><p>After having two sons die within the first two years of their lives, and then giving birth to three daughters (my mother’s three older sisters), my grandmother never forgave my mother for being born. “I needed you like I needed a hole in my head,” she often said to her, and she beat her frequently. When I mentioned this to one of my older cousins, she told me about the time when, as a young girl, she watched her mother also being beaten by our grandmother as, all the while, our great-grandmother kept shouting, “Harder! Harder! Harder!”</p><p>My maternal grandparents fought with each other so ferociously—my mother once watched my grandmother lift my grandfather bodily and throw him down the stairs from the second-floor landing of their house—that throughout her childhood she lived with the fear that, as sometimes happened, she’d arrive home to find the police there to break up her parents’ fights.</p><p>Her parents separated before I was born and never again lived together. My grandfather had wanted to marry my grandmother’s younger sister but was told by her father that if he married an older sister, he would receive a handsome dowry. My grandfather married the older sister, and in a story that mimicked many of Dickens’s novels—The Mystery of Edwin Drood, The Old Curiosity Shop, and Martin Chuzzlewit, where young men and women rarely get to marry the person they love (at least at first)—my grandfather never received the promised dowry and remained forever bitter about this betrayal. After my grandparents separated, he lived in the Bialystoker Home for Jewish Men on the Lower East Side, where he worked as a baker to help defray fees, sharing with other Jewish men a dormitory-like room in which he had nothing of his own but a narrow iron-frame bed and a small dresser.</p><p>My grandmother lived in the three-story building in Williamsburg in which my mother had grown up. Although my grandparents owned the house, my grandmother was its janitor and custodian, scrubbing the hallway floors and staircases, loading the furnace with coal, hauling away the ashes. My mother often told the story of her embarrassment at bringing a friend home from school and finding her mother on her hands and knees in front of the house, repairing the sidewalk with cement.</p><p>In 1913, when my mother was two years old, my grandmother gave birth to a boy, my uncle Izzy, who became my grandmother’s favorite; and seven years after Izzy’s birth, she gave birth to a fifth daughter, Evelyn, who, as the family’s pampered “baby,” was spared the physical abuse my grandmother visited on my mother. Evelyn became a nurse, and the mother of four children, two boys and two girls; Evelyn’s husband sexually abused both daughters, and one of Evelyn’s sons, my cousin Martin, committed suicide at the age of nineteen by jumping off the roof of a hospital in Queens. My uncle Izzy passed away in 1954 at the age of forty-one.</p><p>Using the promise of bequeathing the house they owned in Williamsburg, my grandparents succeeded in making their six children choose sides in a never-ending war, much like the constant battles in Bleak House that John Jarndyce calls “the family curse.” And so, for many years, my mother’s eldest sister and her brother Izzy did not talk to my mother. Neither did my grandmother and my mother speak with each other for the last eight years of my grandmother’s life. In January 1955, less than a year after Izzy died, my grandmother was found unconscious at the bottom of the cellar stairs in her building. She died a few days later; how she fell remains a mystery. After her death, my mother and her sisters were able to put aside their quarrels, to divide proceeds from the sale of the house equally, and to give an equal share to Izzy’s widow.</p><p>When people asked why she chose to stay with my father, my mother always said the same thing: “I know he’ll never hurt me.” Yet our father, mild-mannered and withdrawn as he was most of the time, did have temper tantrums during which he’d smash dishes, spit at Robert, and slap me around. If something I’d done or, more often, had not done, displeased our mother—and it was my job, weekday afternoons, to take care of Robert, run errands, clean the apartment, and prepare supper—my father would, like a petulant child, stamp his feet, scream, and strike out at me.</p><p>Neither Robert nor I knew at the time what my friend Milton, who lived in the apartment above ours, told me after my father died: that he and his parents several times heard our father screaming that he was going to kill himself—“It’s the end! It’s the end!” he’d cry. “I can’t take it anymore! I can’t take it anymore!”—at which cries Milton’s father would rush downstairs, and bang on the door until my father opened it and let him in.</p><p>In the fall of 1958, at the start of my senior year of college, my father, then fifty-four years old, filed for bankruptcy. He wept when he came home from court, talking about the shame he felt for not having repaid friends and relatives who, through the years, had been secretly loaning him money. I knew about these loans because it had been my job to get to the mailbox every day before our mother arrived home from work, take out letters addressed to my father, and sneak them to him when our mother wasn’t around. For her part, my mother one afternoon invited me into her bedroom, and told me about her secret savings accounts (a friend held the bankbooks), in which she was putting away money we’d need when our father went out of business or was unable to work. In the event, following his bankruptcy, my father took a seventy-five-dollar-a-week job as a clerk in a stationery store in the Wall Street district.</p><p>That my mother might become seriously ill and be unable to work seemed impossible to me, for no matter her constant threats that “someday soon” she was going to collapse and leave us to fend on our own, she seemed indestructible. In fact, other than times she had migraines—for which she would lie in bed, the room dark, with a cold compress over her eyes; or take enemas, the olive-drab rubber douche bag and tubes forever hanging from the shower curtain rod above our bathtub—I have no memory of ever seeing her sick.</p><p>When I was nine years old, I used my small savings to buy her a scented Valentine’s Day card. She threw it in my face. “Anyone can buy a card,” she said. “If you really loved me, you would have made me a card.” As painful as it was to have her withdraw her love from me, or to watch her humiliate our father, I remained, always, in awe of her strengths: her tireless capacity for work, her boundless energy and stamina, her shameless and dogged pursuit of anything and everything she desired, and, most remarkable perhaps, given her vindictive streak, the sheer joy she took in life. At family gatherings, she would hold forth with tales of doctors, patients, and youthful adventures, tell off-color jokes, and laugh so hard at stories she and others told that I was frequently astonished, and thrilled, to hear her cry out, “Stop already—stop before you make me wet my pants!”</p><p>To the world that existed beyond the four rooms of our apartment, she was forever smiling, vivacious, outgoing, and generous. She was also forever touching, hugging, and kissing everyone, not only her friends and relatives, but also my friends, and even strangers with whom she’d initiate conversations in stores, in subway stations, and at bus stops. On weekend afternoons, despite my father’s complaints that she was giving the men washing their cars in the backyard “a free show,” she often paraded around the apartment in nothing but her panties.</p><p>To the boy and young man who craved her approval, gratitude, and affection—all of which I did receive, if generously mixed with their opposites—she was to me what she was to my father: the most wonderful and beautiful woman in the world, and I took strength from her strengths. In my determination never to be a failure like my father, so as never to visit on a family of mine the suffering his inability to earn a living had inflicted on ours, I identified with my mother’s frustration, her rage, her insatiable need for love and praise, and the ways they fueled the fierce will that fired her ability not only to survive and to enable our family to survive, but to thrive.</p><p>“I want what I want when I want it!” she regularly announced, and as sweet and charming as she could be when being sweet and charming suited her purposes, she could also be venomous and ruthless. She took as much pride in her ability to drive down the price of a used car or a new dress, or in the twenty-five-dollar commission she earned for persuading a family to send its child to the summer camp we went to, where she worked as camp nurse, as she did from forcing our father into bankruptcy, an event that would come painfully to mind when, years later, I read about the evil Mr. Smallweed in Bleak House, doing the same to the disgraced and innocent Mr. George.</p><p>When my brother Robert was sixteen years old, she became alarmed by what she considered his bizarre eating habits, weird combinations of clothes, dangerous “beatnik” friends, and erratic schoolwork (exceptionally high grades in some subjects, exceptionally low grades in others). She decided he was “sick,” and had to be put away permanently in a mental hospital. When she had him evaluated by the director of Adolescent Services at Kings County Hospital, the doctor told her not to waste time with psychotherapy: Robert would indeed need to live in a mental institution for the rest of his life and should be placed in one immediately. “See!” she said, when she presented us with the news. “You thought I was the crazy one, but I wasn’t. Oh no! You were all against me—all three of you—but I persevered and guess what? I was proven right!”</p><p>In some of his essays, though not in his novels, Dickens wrote about the deplorable conditions he found in London’s lunatic asylums—conditions not unlike those I’d find in the mental hospitals in which my brother was incarcerated. But Dickens’s interest was not only that of a social reformer: while pursuing an affair with the actress Ellen Ternan, he attempted to have his wife committed to one of these institutions.</p><p>When I asked Robert to explain what had happened during his evaluation at Kings County, he laughed and said he’d wanted to find out what the inside of an insane asylum was like, so he’d given the doctor answers he knew he was looking for. I congratulated him on passing the admission test, but remarked that once he was inside, it might not be so easy to get out. Robert saw my point, and agreed to go for a second evaluation. With my friend Milton’s help—he’d recently finished training as a psychologist—I was able to have Robert evaluated by the director of Adolescent Services at Bellevue Hospital. This doctor concluded that Robert did not need to be hospitalized, and did not even need psychotherapy.</p><p>Two and a half years later, however, after winning a Regents Scholarship from New York State and completing his freshman year of college at the City College of New York, Robert did have a major psychotic episode. He was admitted for six weeks to the psych ward of Elmhurst Hospital, in Queens, and then, for a year and a half, at reduced fees my mother succeeded in obtaining, in a private psychiatric hospital. He recovered, completed a second year of college, but suffered a further breakdown, after which he spent the rest of his life—another fifty years—in and out of psychiatric hospitals and halfway houses. In 1973, when he was incarcerated on an insulin coma ward of the notorious Creedmoor Psychiatric Hospital, our parents moved to a retirement village in West Palm Beach, Florida. Robert was then twenty-nine years old; our father died three years later without ever seeing him again. Our mother lived for another thirty years. During that time, she saw Robert twice.</p><p>During my undergraduate years, I completed two unpublished novels, and in the five years that followed I completed six more books (five novels, one nonfiction book). By the time I had a novel accepted for publication, in 1965, when I was twenty-seven, I had accumulated more than two thousand rejections.  </p><p>I’d started, in fact, when I was eight years old, writing out a seventy-page novel that my mother typed up for me. On the page the words came out, gloriously, half-red and half-black. For several months, on Monday mornings, I read a new chapter of the novel to my fourth grade class at PS 246, and I can still recall the joy I felt when, at recess and lunch, my classmates would crowd around and ask me to tell them what was going to happen next, to which I’d reply that I never knew until I sat down and began writing.</p><p>Between the time I wrote the seventy-page novel, and my graduation from high school, I don’t recall having any thoughts about becoming a writer. When I entered Columbia in the fall of 1955, I listed architecture and advertising as my two career ambitions. In my freshman year, however, I was away from home for the first time in my life, commuting two hours a day by subway and staying on campus until late in the evening. By the end of that year, I’d begun reading voraciously again, in the way that I had as a child; and I began writing short stories and conjuring up novels. </p><p>Then, shortly before my nineteenth birthday, in 1957, I checked in at Columbia University’s Student Health Service about some swollen glands that had lingered on after a sore throat and subsequently underwent a biopsy. Diagnosed with a type of lymphoma that, I learned later, was considered the first stage of Hodgkin’s disease, I received radiation treatment. At the time, what I was told was that the lymph nodes, removed by surgery, were “benign” and the radiation “a precaution.” The true implications of the diagnosis were kept from me, but part of me believed I did have cancer; convinced that I had only a year left to live, I decided it was time to do what I’d been longing to do. After my parents and Robert were asleep, I’d go into our kitchen, put my typewriter on towels to muffle its click-clacking, and work on what would become my first real novel. Two years later, still in remission from cancer—as I am, all these years later—I wrote a second one.</p><p>Then, as now, when people asked what inspired me and kept me going, I said what many writers have said: that my desire to become a writer derived from my childhood love of reading. And then I’d talk about how the happiest hours of my childhood were those I’d spent reading novels by Dickens from our family’s set of his complete works, and about how I’d dreamed of the day when I’d have a shelf of books with my name on them that would be as wide as that twenty-volume set. It would be many years, and many books, later, however, before I realized the effect my mother’s fussing so much over the book I wrote when I was in the fourth grade—calling me her “little genius,” bragging about it, trying to get it published—had had on me. To protect what would become the dear and beloved companion of my life, writing, and keep it from being taken away from me, I had apparently buried my desire to be a writer so far underground that even I didn’t know it existed.  </p><p>When I was in the act of writing, I felt capable of making sense of a world that often seemed without sense, and this experience served, as reading novels and stories had, to protect me from the currents of madness that swirled around me, and that sometimes coursed within me. While I was writing, or simply reading, I could for a while shut out such feelings and be transported to a world that, no matter how terrifying, mad, strange, or cruel, was not the one I actually lived in. That world in writing did not have the power to hurt me, drive me mad, or take away what was precious to me.</p><p>When my parents moved to Florida, they had the complete set of Dickens and the mahogany breakfront shipped to me in North Hadley, Massachusetts, where I was then living and raising my own family. In 2003, when I moved from there to an apartment on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, I shipped the breakfront to my daughter, Miriam, who lived in Falls Church, Virginia. But I kept the books.</p><p>And when, a few weeks ago, I took down from my shelves Dickens’s Great Expectations and found the “Dear Reader” letter, I was transported again—as I’d been so often while reading Dickens—to that mid-century world of my childhood—that world in which first-generation immigrants like my parents aspired to become part of the greater American experience that existed beyond our cramped apartments and struggling families, and to do so, in part, by owning books by “great” writers and keeping them “in a place of honor” that “distinguished” their owners for their “discriminating taste,” and gave them the gift of a “library” they could “treasure… for all time.”</p><p>Now, in the spring of 2020, isolated in my New York City apartment, I took down The Pickwick Papers, Dickens’s first published novel, and began reading. But as the prospect of rereading all of Dickens beckoned, I thought, too, of Evelyn Waugh’s A Handful of Dust. In that novel, Tony Last, an English country gentleman, goes on an expedition in search of a supposed lost city in the Amazon rainforest. On the journey, he falls ill, and is cared for by Mr. Todd, a British Guianan who lives in a remote part of the jungle. Although he is illiterate, Todd owns a set of the complete works of Dickens, and asks Last to read to him—first Bleak House, then Dombey and Son, Little Dorrit, Oliver Twist, and Nicholas Nickleby. Meanwhile, a rescue party sent out to search for Last approaches. Todd conceals Last after drugging him into a comatose state, and tricks the would-be rescuers into believing that Last is dead. When Last comes round, he realizes there is no escape: he has been condemned to spend the rest of his life in the jungle reading Dickens to Todd.</p><p>“Let us read Little Dorrit again,” Todd says, near the end of A Handful of Dust. “There are passages in that book I can never hear without the temptation to weep.”</p>",

  "content": "<p>Once, during a difficult year in my life, I had no choice but to read on trains. At three in the morning, every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, I would board the train from New York to New Haven. Around five, I would switch to the train from New Haven to New London, a ghost train with dirty windows and frozen seats and wheels that protested all the way up and all the way down the shoreline. Just after sunrise, I would teach one class at Connecticut College, then take the train back to New Haven; teach two classes at Yale, then take the train back to New York; pull into Grand Central after dark, navigate the subway to Brooklyn and arrive home to fall asleep. I did this while pregnant with my older son, while interviewing for jobs and while working freelance as an editor to afford health insurance. I had no office—only my seat on the train, and, on lucky days, the one next to me as well.</p><p>So, I am trying to imagine what I might have done if, one evening on the 4, 5, a man—call him Tim from last month’s installment of the Reading Room—had sat across from me, whipped Henry James’s The Wings of the Dove out of his messenger bag and cast about the car for meaningful eye contact. “It wasn’t, in a word, simply that their eyes had met; other conscious organs, faculties, feelers had met as well, and when Kate afterwards imaged to herself the sharp, deep fact she saw it, in the oddest way, as a particular performance,” James writes of Kate Croy and Merton Densher’s momentous encounter. This exquisitely heightened perception, this intensely unspoken communion, this supremely self-conscious performance—this whole setup would have struck me as absurd had it occurred to me, which it wouldn’t have. My faculties and feelers were blunted by many varieties of exhaustion. Plus, my vision coverage had lapsed and, because I was too anxious about money to renew my prescription, I had taken to sneaking my husband’s contact lenses. Novelists like James like the image of lovers with eyes in each other’s eyes, but I found it less conducive to emotional vertigo than to vertiginous migraines. Faces and signs kept wobbling out of focus; I was always waving down strangers only to wave them away in horror. Would Tim have cared about any of this? Or would he simply have wanted to look deep into my unfocused eyes and feel his feelings?</p><p>My point is that literary romance—or rather, the ability to imagine reading literature as a rarefied occasion for romance, played out against the backdrop of some fetishized locale—requires a talent for forgetting one’s material position and cares. (One senses that Kate is more aware of this than Merton. Meeting him on the underground, she is affected, but upon emerging into the daylight, she thinks that their relationship might “best be described in the terms of the baker and the housemaid.”) Sarah and Tim both describe literary romance as an adolescent indulgence, though adolescents are not the ones most likely to abuse it. Rather, there exists a figure in contemporary literature culture who stands out as the worst offender; a figure Tim does an exemplary job voicing in his essay (though not without the requisite irony): the longing man—long-searching, long-suffering and long-irritating. In America, he is the soft boy, an aesthete, thoughtful and gently manipulative. In England, he is the sad boy, poetic and lachrymose. He is the beta narcissist in clinical terms. He is the male Madame Bovary in literary ones. But in my mind, he is always the longing man. No matter his age or his nationality, he comes well equipped with all the adolescent’s self-regard and none of the adolescent’s excuses, always ready to be swept upward, away from the worldly concerns of the baker and the housemaid and into the realm of “higher love-making,” as Goethe writes in “The Holy Longing.”</p><p>Yearning, indecision, impossibility—the frustrated agency of romance proves endlessly fascinating to the longing man. He believes in soul mates, in beloveds and in the inevitability of cultivating his feelings for them, in cultivating his feelings through them. “Men who belong to the tribe of this myth can find their other half in every tree and every flower,” writes Georg Lukács in “Longing and Form.” “Every encounter in their lives becomes a wedding.” Married, mostly married, incidentally married—what is marriage anyway? It’s all so bewildering to the longing man, who knows that his emotions are uniquely complex and will seize every opportunity to make sure you know it too. Only novels and poems are elevated enough to offer the appropriately aestheticized correlative to his being. Turning to them, he frequently conflates life with literature, people with texts. “‘The women one meets—what are they but books one has already read?’ Merton tells Kate. “‘You’re a whole library of the unknown, the uncut.’ He almost moaned, he ached, from the depths of his content. ‘Upon my word I’ve a subscription!’” It is essential to the longing man that the women he meets remain unread (and that they keep producing the content that he refuses to read). If he were to read them, if he were to know them, he might discover all sorts of realities inconvenient to his desire.</p><p>Does the longing man have a precursor? He does, indeed he does. There might have been no longing man at all were it not for Dante, for Petrarch. We could hardly imagine him without Keats and Kafka; without Fanny, Felice and Milena, the women whom these longing men preferred to see not as solid, separable beings, but “through the mist of Plots speeches, counterplots, and counter speeches,” as Keats once confessed to Fanny. German Romanticism gave the longing man his elemental form, his Dem Sehnenden, but Proust perfected him in his narrator’s imaginative possession of Albertine, who, as Anne Carson reminds us, “is present or mentioned on 807 pages of Proust’s novel. On a good 19 percent of these pages she is asleep.” Modernism yoked the character of the longing man to nostalgic and patriarchal ideals of social organization: the American Dream of Jay Gatsby; the Southern Code of Quentin Compson; the English Civilization of Peter Walsh; the Republic of the Spirit of Lawrence Selden. My female students, who have gotten very good at detecting irony (on the part of the author) and bullshit (on the part of the character), see through the longing man’s self-serving fantasies immediately. The longing male reader, not so much.</p><p>Today, we find longing men haunting the genre Mark McGurl calls “the beta intellectual romance,” novels generally written by, or about, editors at n+1.1Mark McGurl, “Unspeakable Conventionality: The Perversity of the Kindle,” forthcoming from Verso. By contrast to the rich, decisive executives who dominate women in mass-market “alpha billionaire romances,” the longing men featured in beta intellectual romances are sad, confused, precariously employed and too hung up on sex to have it—far better, they believe, to yammer on about the meaning of “love,” the immateriality of “the erotic.” The contemporary longing man has superficially absorbed the basic lessons of feminism. Certainly, he knows how to use the word in a sentence. Yet his vacillations are as disturbing in their own way as the abuses of the alpha billionaires. “Even at peak physical performance they seize the historical privilege of romantic indecision and wield it as a kind of soft power,” McGurl writes of longing men. When it comes to dominating the ladies, they “do not want to whip them, just to waste their time.”</p><p>But not every longing man can be Keats or Kafka or even Ben Lerner. The longing men one encounters outside of novels, the ones who, in bygone days, would sidle up at conference bars and now slide into your DMs, cannot be counted on for a fancy prose style. Lacking artfulness, the average longing man’s textual practice is best described as one of clumsy sublimation; of horniness draped in corniness. (“I dive, as it were, into a spacious bath of subclauses and subtleties,” Tim writes, knowing that reading in the bath is the longing man’s favorite pastime.) The longing man will never acknowledge his desire frankly, will turn everything and anything into a cipher, a code insultingly easy to crack. He often appears to be engaged in a long, unrequited emotional affair with the moon. (Sorry, Kamran.)</p><p>For me, the longing man’s greatest offense must be his humorlessness. Irony, instead of masking sentimentality, gets swallowed whole by it. Transfixed by the beauty, the mystery of his melancholy, he cannot hear the voice of his inner critic pleading with him to be just a little less self-serious, a little less cringe. Watching his particular performance of inwardness, one feels a strong sense of embarrassment, of pity mingled with incredulity. His intense narcissism is cut by an equally intense commitment to being overwhelmed by the intensity of his feelings. “Thus, I can’t resist the temptation to do exactly the annoying thing that Sarah warned against,” writes Tim in character as longing man, determined to wax rhapsodic despite a woman’s request that he please restrain himself. “I can’t resist”—the longing man’s lament. “Surely she will put up with it”—the longing man’s pacifier.</p><p>The question of style brings us back to Henry James. What is with the longing man and Henry James? In “Henry James and Me,” an essay I like very much for its genuinely insightful practice of self-reflection, reformed longing man Simon During reflects on the relationship between Jamesian style and literary desire.2Simon During, “Henry James and Me,” MLN 118.5 (December 2003), 1278-93. He suspects that the ornate, indirect language of James’s characters appealed to him when he was a longing teenager because it helped him cultivate a romantic opacity, an absent presence. Part of that opacity entailed the refusal of normative judgments, among them the expectation that one would honestly and explicitly articulate one’s moral responsibilities toward others. James’s fiction provided him with a model for how one might vanquish “the social empire of avowed mutual understanding, and norms that can be openly appealed to” in favor of the tacit, the undisclosed. Without any clear-cut and collectively established rules of attraction, one could develop a sense for another person only “at a remove from constative language—through literary figures.” “This was for me a final seduction,” During concludes: “a world where literature would take central stage.”</p><p>Yet for During, the individual impulse to longing has a strong social dimension. In James’s fiction, the desire to see others only through the prism of literary fiction responded to what James understood as “the waning of ‘literary desire’ … a perceived public failure justly to acknowledge the art of fiction to which he had dedicated much of his life.” Though During argues that literary desire has been alive and well since James, he does cautiously lament the waning of scholarly desire—or rather, the desire for scholars and their continued employment. When he first read James, During confesses, he believed the humanities would allow him to approach the “materialization of a heritage that I knew could never be mine.” He longed for real estate, for the English manor houses, the Venetian palazzos. “Innocent as I then was, I was unable to conceive of the cruel irony which haunts professors of literature—the force with which the conditions of academic employment order one’s life away from the styles, tones and possibilities promoted within literary texts (broadly speaking) themselves,” he writes. The longing for “a world where literature would take central stage,” as an affair of un-intimate, unethical selves, gains its intensity from the cruelty of a world that has yanked literature off center stage as a sustainable professional endeavor. Forget about houses and palazzos; now what one yearns for is two empty adjoining seats on a train.</p><p>The longing man creates the illusion that the romance of reading can generate a deep, forgetful pleasure, elevating the literary above such worldly concerns as budgets and balance sheets, adjuncts’ pay and health insurance. But behind the pantomime lies the unsexy truth. Like all of us, the longing man is getting mind-blowingly, earth-shatteringly, ingloriously fucked, unerotically asphyxiated by the tightening grip of austerity. Unwilling to face the irony of the widening gap between the possibilities promoted by literary professionalism and the possibilities promoted by literary fiction, he retreats into his fantasies. Yet what he truly longs for is neither sex nor romance. It is autonomy.</p><p>“The longing man is a stranger to himself because he is not beautiful, and a stranger to beauty because it is beautiful,” writes Lukacs on the longing man’s hopeless quest for autonomy. “Eros is in the middle: he is truly the son of wealth and poverty.” The best advice one can give a woman faced with a longing man is to read him symptomatically, as a figure suspended somewhere between the wealth of the literary imagination and the poverty of its professional status. Nothing short-circuits the longing man’s desire or his individualism like stripping it of the singularity he insists on imparting it. Critique is a romance killer. (This is a good thing.)</p><p>Here it also emerges as an act of generosity. Short-circuiting the longing man’s desire encourages the rewiring of our relationship to him. Now we may begin to entertain a distant and begrudging sympathy for the whole class of longing men. Yes, their narcissism is tedious and embarrassing. Yes, they conscript women into their fantasies with little regard for their personhood. Still, we feel for them. For when your eyes meet theirs across the train car, or maybe, in the not-so-distant future, over Zoom, you realize that their impotence is our impotence writ large. Their passivity is our passivity; their moon our moon. And being a good reader—a reader committed to the value of literature—may require some stolen glances into their territory.</p><p>Let me try to imagine, Sliding Doors-style, how I might have reacted to the man in the train car reading The Wings of the Dove. Our eyes meet, his wistful, woeful; mine, irritated. (I once wore my husband’s contacts for so long I developed a corneal abrasion in my right eye and, for two weeks, wore an eye patch improvised from a pirate costume.) I rise to get off at the next stop and, as I do, fix him with my one good eye. “It’s an excellent book,” I say. “You should try reading it.”</p><p>Or our eyes meet, and, holding his gaze, I rise from my seat, float over to him, gently pluck The Wings of the Dove from his hand, and hand him another novel—a novel that asks him to think more socially and less romantically; that bends toward comedy rather than tragedy; that makes him long with anger rather than melancholy for a future less depleted than his present. We ride to our shared stop, laughing and chatting about it, and when we disembark, the world outside the station is touched by the “subtle, unromantic magic” Sarah described in her column. There is always a risk, I think, as we go our separate ways, that the longing man will read this novel wrong, too. But it’s a risk I’m willing to take.</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you liked this essay, you’ll love reading The Point in print.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> Comparing the Nazis’ rise to Donald Trump’s, writers over the past four years have often had reason to focus on the Weimar Republic, which lasted…   </p><p> This is the seventh installment of our “Home Movies” column by Philippa Snow, about what we watch when no one’s watching. Watched this week: Vox…   </p><p> While Sarah concludes that she enjoys reading in the company of others—though not in relation to “someone else’s desire”—I haven’t yet entirely disentangled reading from…   </p>",

  "content": "<p>I remember the precise moment in 1992 when, having arrived at Page 212, I abandoned the novel I was writing. Poseidon Press had already given me a contract, and I’d set about composing the story. At this particular moment, a man was asking a woman to crawl naked across the floor to prove the extent of his domination over her. I could envision the scene exactly in my head, and I wrote it in Technicolor detail: the reluctant shedding of her clothes, her awkward getting down on hands and knees, the feel of her breasts scraping the floor.</p><p>And then I stopped dead. One reason was that I couldn’t find a way to rescue my self-destructive protagonist from her dilemma — her search for love from a man who had none to offer — except through some kind of melodramatic device. Could a woman who entered this overheated and dangerous territory manage to leave it behind without killing herself (as Anna Karenina does), becoming a dehumanized slave (like the title character does in “Story of O”) or going nuts (as Ingeborg Day does in her memoir, “Nine and a Half Weeks”)? Was this kind of deus ex machina inevitable?</p><p>The other hindrance was that, like my protagonist, I was still struggling with this sort of dilemma, reliably heading straight into the arms of the wrong man who’d looked right at first. I wasn’t alone, either: Several friends of mine had at some point exercised “bad taste” in their choice of a male partner. Such men typically mistreated these women but held their affection anyway, usually because of their sexual allure — until, finally, one day, the women would break free, with the help of a therapist or their own willpower, and go on to make more suitable matches. As for me, I’d spent more than a decade in such twisted relationships. All the paid hours of psychotherapy discussing my past — from a distant, volatile father to a mercurial and controlling mother — had not succeeded in loosening their grip on me. Understanding my choices, or my fictional alter ego’s, would require a clarifying self-awareness and a literary legerdemain that were beyond me at the time.</p><p>I originally sold my novel in the late 1980s based on a conversation with two editors in which I expressed a long-standing wish to explore my fascination with the entwined subjects of erotic obsession and sexual submission. I understood them on some theoretical level that all the same didn’t seem to affect my behavior, and I wanted to know what writers on sadomasochism, and the psychopathology that drives it, thought. There were Theodor Reik, George Bataille, Marguerite Duras, Jean Rhys, a fascinating, little-known writer named Edith Templeton, an early novel by Jenny Diski, the infamous Marquis de Sade, the theatrical “Story of O,” and badly produced paperbacks with cramped print and titles such as “Sexual Variations” and “S-M the Last Taboo.”</p><p>And then there was, perhaps most illuminatingly, the psychoanalyst Robert Stoller’s controversial “Sexual Excitement,” which posits that in large part erotic frisson is caused by an undercurrent of hostility stemming from humiliations endured in both partners’ pasts. Stoller’s Freudian-influenced theory spoke to a carnal attraction predicated precisely on a lack of parity between the sexes, derived from fantasies of total control or total submission. Power is often a natural aphrodisiac, of course, yet sometimes it has less to do with a man’s status in the real world (in the form of wealth, say, or fame) and more to do with a woman’s subconscious wish to be abject, to surrender her inner force to a man who will tell her what to do. Paradoxically, the issue of who is controlling whom becomes an increasingly murky one: Is it the one who dominates or the one who submits?</p><p>I chose an unfortunate moment to explore these themes, which had gone underground in the 1970s and 1980s. Now feminist doctrine held that we were supposed to want nurturing men who washed the dishes and cheered us on as we advanced (even past them) in our careers. Women were meant to embrace “power dressing,” carry briefcases and emulate the male work ethic. But to my mind, the current dogmas serenely overlooked the reality of psychological conflict, in which primitive fantasies and irrational yearnings might continue to flourish beneath the surface of even the most enlightened women. Would my vision of a professionally ambitious young woman captivated by a dominating man — a woman who resisted the siren call of liberation and its accompanying insistence on sexual equality between the sheets — go over poorly in the doctrinaire 1990s?</p><p>I also wondered whether writing about sex would automatically mark me as less serious than other authors, no matter how many essays I had written about Virginia Woolf or V.S. Naipaul. At a moment when novels were tackling post-colonialism and family dysfunction, would my concerns with derailed erotic journeys suggest I was a frivolous, self-indulgent creature, someone unlikely to be a good mother? (Not that writing about sex had compromised either the reputations or the moral standing of male writers like Norman Mailer, John Updike and Philip Roth.)</p><p>All the same, I went off to write the novel on the basis of a generous advance. For three years, I wrote steadily, drawing partly from my own experience: I gave the protagonist a job as a book editor, about which she felt passionate but also skeptical, never quite sure if she should have abandoned the world of academia for the world of marketing photogenic authors. I also began the arduous task of developing an intentionally pernicious love interest whom I based in part on a man I had once been involved with. This man had treated me as his whims dictated — as deeply desirable one minute and disposable the next. I wanted the reader to dislike him but also to understand the magnetic (if malevolent) spell he cast.</p><p>Everything seemed to be going well; my editor liked what I’d drafted and urged me to finish quickly. And then I screeched to a halt. My inhibitions, despite my best efforts to ignore them, had effectively defeated me; I put the novel aside. Decades passed, and I wrote essays and criticism and a memoir, “This Close to Happy.”</p><p>Meanwhile, however, I was unable to leave my novel alone. I went back to it on and off, almost surreptitiously, experimenting with different points of view and different styles. I tried giving my story what I thought of as a Gallic twist, narrating it in a cool and distilled tone. I liked that version, mostly because it seemed to separate the teller from the tale, but I got stuck around Page 70. Finally, three or four years ago, I bit the bullet and went through all the versions I had accumulated over the decades — amounting to more than 1,000 pages — in an effort to figure out how to circumvent my conflicts and fears. Instead of telling the story in media res, as it was taking place, I decided to frame it by having an older version of the protagonist, Judith Stone, married to a decent man and pregnant with her second child, narrate the passionate but abusive liaison of her youth in flashback. This shift to the long view, in turn, allowed me to bring her out of her obsession in one piece. A solution was in sight.</p><p>Then came Harvey Weinstein and the ­#MeToo movement, which detonated just as I was revising my book. I had mixed feelings about the campaign from the start — particularly its draconian separation of men into congenital predators and women into victims without agency. I watched the frenzy to denounce a wide range of male figures (particularly ones who wielded power) and the lack of nuance, the assumption of guilt before an alleged perpetrator could say a word, as happened with Aziz Ansari or those named on the “S---ty Media Men” list. True, I had set my novel in the 1990s and 2000s, before the latest theories about men and women had overtaken the cultural climate, so my protagonist was beyond reproach. But the book’s interest in erotic fixation and female abjection now looked inescapably retrograde. And on top of which, it would land in an environment where activists consistently sought to silence dissenting views.</p><p>It was, to be sure, partly the obdurate contrarian in me — my wish to expose complexities ignored by absolutists of all stripes — that urged me to go forward. But the world had also grown more tolerant since I first embarked on my novel, welcoming different sexual persuasions, gender identities and erotic habits, presumably becoming more shockproof in the process. “50 Shades of Grey” had introduced millions of readers to a toned-down consumerist version of sadomasochistic play; my novel no longer seemed beyond the pale. What’s more, my youthful vanity all spent, I’d grown too old to care about other people’s criticism of me as much as I once had.</p><p>Most important, I wrote fiction for the same reason I read it: to hear one lone voice express itself above the din of political slogans and groupthink. I had always trusted in the power of fiction to illuminate the interior world in which we all reside, to reveal its secret joys and terrors and to highlight the quirks of an individual sensibility over a streamlined collective consensus. “22 Minutes of Unconditional Love” (I abandoned “The Discovery of Sex,” the title I’d first proposed to Poseidon Press all those years ago) is about a woman facing her own complex desires, desires that don’t always fit neatly together. But it’s also about my conviction that inconvenient truths and unwieldy wishes need to be aired — in the hope that other women, entirely different from me, might recognize a buried piece of themselves in it.</p>",

  "content": "<p>These words exist for you to read them. I wrote them to try to convey some ideas to you. These are not the first words I wrote for you—those were worse. I wrote and rewrote, with a view to clarifying my meaning. I want to make sure that what you take away is exactly what I have in mind, and I want to be concise and engaging, because I am mindful of competing demands on your time and attention.</p><p>You might think that everything I am saying is trivial and obvious, because of course all writing is like this. Writing is a form of communication; it exists to be read. But that is, in fact, not how all writing works. In particular, it is not how academic writing works. Academic writing does not exist in order to communicate with a reader. In academia, or at least the part of it that I inhabit, we write, most of the time, not so much for the sake of being read as for the sake of publication.</p><p>Let me illustrate by way of a confession regarding my own academic reading habits. Although I love to read, and read a lot, little of my reading comes from recent philosophy journals. The main occasions on which I read new articles in my areas of specialization are when I am asked to referee or otherwise assess them, when I am helping someone prepare them for publication and when I will need to cite them in my own paper.</p><p>This tells you something about academic writing, and how deeply it is shaped—mostly not at a conscious level—by the refereeing process. The simple fact is that “success” in academia is a matter of journal-acceptance, which in turn makes for a line in one’s CV. The number of such citations, taken together with the prestige of the relevant journals, is what counts for getting, keeping and being promoted in an academic job.</p><p>“Counts” being the operative word. What can be counted is what will get done. In the humanities, no one counts whether anyone reads our papers. Only whether they are published, and where. I have observed these pressures escalate over time: nowadays it is unsurprising when those merely applying to graduate schools have already published a paper or two.</p><p>Writing for the sake of publication—instead of for the sake of being read—is academia’s version of “teaching to the test.” The result is papers few actually want to read. First, the writing is hypercomplex. Yes, the thinking is also complex, but the writing in professional journals regularly contains a layer of complexity beyond what is needed to make the point. It is not edited for style and readability. Most significantly of all, academic writing is obsessed with other academic writing—with finding a “gap in the literature” as opposed to answering a straightforwardly interesting or important question.</p><p>Of course publication is a necessary step along the way to readership, but the academic who sets their sights on it is like the golfer or baseball player who stops their swing when they make contact with the ball. Without follow-through, what you get are short, jerky movements; we academics have become purveyors of small, awkwardly phrased ideas.</p><p>In making these claims about academic writing, I am thinking in the first instance of my own corner of academia—philosophy—though I suspect that my points generalize, at least over the academic humanities. To offer up one anecdote: in spring 2019 I was teaching Joyce’s Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man; since I don’t usually teach literature, I thought I should check out recent secondary literature on Joyce. What I found was abstruse and hypercomplex, laden with terminology and indirect. I didn’t feel I was learning anything I could use to make the meaning of the novel more accessible to myself or to my students. I am willing to take some of the blame here: I am sure I could have gotten something out of those pieces if I had been willing to put more effort into reading them. Still, I do not lack the intellectual competence required to understand analyses of Joyce; I feel all of those writers could have done more to write for me.</p><p>But whether my points generalize across the humanities or not, I will confess that I feel the urgency of the problem for philosophy much more than for some abstract entity called “the humanities.” I love Joyce, I love Homer, but I am not invested in the quality of current scholarship on either. It’s philosophy that I worry about.</p><p>When I am asked for sources of “big ideas” in philosophy—the kind that would get the extra-philosophical world to stand up and take notice—I struggle to list anyone born after 1950. It is sobering to consider that the previous decade produced: Daniel Dennett, Saul Kripke, David Lewis, Derek Parfit, John McDowell, Peter Singer, G. A. Cohen and Martha Nussbaum. In my view, each of these people towers over everyone who comes after them in at least one of the categories by which we might judge a philosopher: breadth, depth, originality or degree of public influence. Or consider this group, born in roughly the two decades prior (1919-1938), remarkable in its intellectual fertility: Elizabeth Anscombe, Philippa Foot, Stanley Cavell, Harry Frankfurt, Bernard Williams, Thomas Nagel, Robert Nozick, Richard Rorty, Hilary Putnam, John Rawls. These are the philosophers about whom one routinely asks, “Why don’t people write philosophy like this anymore?” And this isn’t only a point about writing style. Their work is inviting—it asks new questions, it sells the reader on why those questions matter and it presents itself as a point of entry into philosophy. This is why all of us keep assigning their work over and over again, a striking fact given how much the number of philosophers has ballooned since their time.</p><p>And it’s not just a matter of a few exceptional figures. A few years ago, I happened to browse through back issues of a top journal (Ethics) from 1940-1950—not an easy decade for the world, or academia. I went in assuming those papers would be of much lower quality than what is being put out now. Keep in mind, this is a time when not only was publication not required for getting a job, even a Ph.D. was not required; there were far fewer philosophers, and getting a paper accepted at a journal was a vastly less competitive process.</p><p>In general, I would describe the papers from that decade as lacking something in terms of precision, clarity and “scholarliness,” but also as being more engaging and ambitious, more heterogeneous in tone and writing style, and better written. Perhaps some amount of academic competition is salutary, but the all-consuming competition of recent years, it appears, has been less productive of excellence than of homogeneity and stagnation. Because the most reliable mark of “quality” is familiarity, the machine incentivizes keeping innovation to a minimum—only at the margin, just enough to get published. It constricts the space of thought. Over time, we end up with less and less to show for all the effort, talent and philosophical training we are throwing into philosophical research. If I wanted to make progress on one of my own papers, I’d certainly be better served with a paper from Ethics in 2020—I’m much more likely to want to cite it. But if I were just curiously browsing for some philosophical reading, I’d go for one of those back issues. We might be hitting more balls today, but none of them is going far.</p><p>Some see a way out: they call it “public philosophy.” But it is a mistake to think that this represents an escape from the problem I am describing. We do not have two systems for doing philosophy, “academic philosophy” and “public philosophy.” “Public philosophy,” including the piece of it you are currently reading, is written mostly by academic philosophers—which is to say, people who studied, received Ph.D.s at and in the vast majority of cases make a living by working within the academic philosophy system.</p><p>I have no objection to applying the title “philosopher” broadly, including to those public intellectuals who have had so much more success in speaking to a general audience than I or any of my colleagues who operate more strictly within the confines of academic philosophy: from Judith Butler and Bruno Latour to Slavoj Žižek, Camille Paglia and Steven Pinker. But it is one thing to be a “philosopher” in the sense of being a source of intellectual inspiration to the public, or a subset thereof, and another to be a member of a philosophical community. The latter designation requires a person not only to be beholden to such a community argumentatively, but also calls for participation in the maintenance and self-reproduction of that community through education, training and management. Academic philosophy is the system we have. You can’t jump ship, because there’s nowhere to jump.</p><p>The sad thing about being stuck reading narrow, boring, abstruse papers is not how bad they are, but how good they are. When I am enough of an insider to be in a position to engage the writer in back-and-forth questioning, either in speech or in writing, that process of objection and pushback tends to expose a real and powerful line of thought driving the piece. Philosophers haven’t stopped loving knowledge, despite the increasingly narrow confines within which we must, if we are to survive, pursue it.</p><p>Some in the philosophical community will defend this “narrowing” as a sign of the increasingly scientific character of philosophy. But no matter how scientific some parts of philosophy become, the following difference will always remain: unlike science, philosophy cannot benefit those who don’t engage in it. Philosophical technology—ideas, arguments, distinctions, questions—cannot live outside the human mind.</p><p>One doesn’t need to idolize Socrates, as I happen to, to think that philosophy is an especially dialogical discipline. All academic work invites response in the weak sense of “there is always more to be said,” or “corrections welcome,” but philosophical talks, papers and books specifically aim to provoke, to incite, to court pushback and counterexample. Our task is not to take some questions off humanity’s plate, but to infect others with our need to find answers.</p><p>The philosopher is an especially needy kind of truth-seeker. Like vampires, zombies and werewolves, we are creatures who need company, and who will do whatever it takes to create it.</p><p>No one thinks that Plato, Descartes, Kant and the rest were right about everything; nonetheless, centuries and millennia later, we cannot stop talking not just about them, but to them, with them. They made us into one of them, and we need to keep paying that forward.</p><p>In the interest of encouraging more philosophical writing like this, consider subscribing to The Point. Use the code PERISH this week for 25% off your first subscription (with 3 print issues and unlimited online access).</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you liked this essay, you’ll love reading The Point in print.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> Every human death feels unnatural.

  "content": "<p>Researching Cuba as a Canadian living in New York was a disorienting experience. When I would describe my work, most people would react with surprise, curiosity, and even envy: Had I actually been there? At times, it seemed like views were as polarized as in any Israel-­Palestine debate. Back in Alberta, Canada’s supposed conservative heartland, my topic of study was met with shrugs. As I planned my first trip to Havana, a friend commented, “You can go there when you’re sixty. Why not try someplace interesting, like Argentina?”</p><p>Such reactions were a constant reminder that Cuba means different things to different people in different places. They were also the direct results of different foreign policies.</p><p>Fidel Castro and his band of guerrillas came to power in 1959, and the United States has been pushing for regime change since 1960, when the famous embargo was born. Washington prohibits most of its citizens from visiting Cuba; even Barack Obama’s 2016 reforms did not allow for unfettered tourism. Meanwhile, Canada is nearly the only state in the Americas to have consistently maintained diplomatic and economic relations with the island for the past sixty years (Mexico is the other). In a typical year, Canadians make over a million visits, mostly to beach resorts. In our popular imagination, Cuba is less “forbidden fruit” and more “Cancún with old cars and bad food.”</p><p>There are no beaches in Frédérick Lavoie’s Orwell in Cuba. But the journalist from Quebec evokes another familiar framework: Cuba as a crumbling Communist relic caught between the past and the future. This work presents itself as a time capsule, with its original title poignantly expressing a sense of temporal suspension: Avant l’après, literally “before the after.” Having won the 2018 Governor General’s Award for French non-­fiction, it has now been translated into English by Donald Winkler.</p><p>Lavoie had every reason to think Cuba was on the brink of a major transition when he made three trips there between February 2016 and February 2017. His first visit immediately preceded Obama’s arrival in Havana, which marked the most dramatic shift in U.S.-­Cuba relations in fifty years. The president denounced the embargo, and the movement toward reconciliation appeared irreversible. (Lavoie’s observation that “no matter who succeeds Obama as president in November, a return to the past seems more and more improbable” now has a tragic ring to it.) By the time of the author’s final visit, Donald Trump had been inaugurated and Fidel Castro had died, at the age of ninety.</p><p>Trump has not (yet) entirely reversed Obama’s reforms, but he has scaled them back dramatically, and the end of the embargo is no longer in sight. Meanwhile, Castro’s death in 2016 had little effect on the functioning of a state that had been run by his brother Raúl for a decade, and it certainly did not bring about the crisis of legitimacy some had hoped for. Last year, Raúl passed the presidency on to Miguel Díaz‑Canel, a bureaucrat from a younger generation, while remaining head of the Communist Party. Again, there has been no upheaval. The “after” may yet be some ways off.</p><p>Lavoie visited the island, in part, to solve a mystery. In 2016, a Cuban publishing house announced that it would launch a new translation of George Orwell’s 1984 at Havana’s International Book Fair. The choice was puzzling. A one-­party state with a long history of censorship was doing more than allowing the publication of a classic critique of totalitarianism: it was mass-producing it and promoting it at a major event. Was this a sign of how much had changed, or a cynical attempt to make Cuba appear more liberal than it was? Or was the publisher simply hoping for a bestseller, now that the state was inching toward market-­based reforms and had less time for ideological purity? Such questions, as well as a close dialogue with Orwell’s writing, dominate Lavoie’s book.</p><p>As an investigation of how censorship affects literature, the arts, and the media, Orwell in Cuba is nuanced and compelling. The central challenge in confronting Cuban censorship is its indeterminacy. The highly visible arrests of the artists El Sexto and Tania Bruguera are exceptions to a process that is generally much more covert. There is no official list of banned books, for one thing; unwanted titles simply go undistributed. Although all presses were nationalized in the ’60s, the mechanisms of editorial decision making remain obscure. Individuals push the envelope, proposing new editions of material previously assumed to be unacceptable. The only clear red line is the explicit and named denunciation of the Castro brothers. Even then, different rules apply for foreigners, and Lavoie is able to cross that line with seemingly few consequences.</p><p>In his quest to unravel the details behind 1984’s publication, Lavoie constantly runs up against these uncertainties. Some of his interlocutors may be lying. The vast majority have only a partial idea of what is going on. At times, he even comes off as paranoid — assuming acts of resistance when none were intended or being taken aback that some of his companions criticize the regime so openly. Indeed, it’s almost commonplace among literature scholars in Cuba to discuss and condemn the intense censorship of the 1970s, as many writers banned during that period have since been rehabilitated. But ongoing uncertainty about what is now allowed is also part of how censorship functions. People moderate themselves in an effort to avoid crossing poorly defined boundaries, making it only rarely necessary for the regime itself to enforce them.</p><p>It would be careless, in discussing a book that revolves around a translation and largely stars Cuban translators, not to discuss the translation here. Donald Winkler has three of his own Governor General’s Awards, and his treatment of Orwell in Cuba is consistently expressive, hitting a tone at once educated and accessible. He has the opportunity to show his chops when Lavoie breaks with his reportage format to include a satirical miniature play and a long poem. For the most part, though, the style is deliberately straightforward, eloquent but not showy; one is reminded of the guidelines that Orwell himself laid out in “Politics and the English Language.”</p><p>At times, Lavoie’s own reliance on Orwell goes too far, suggesting that censorship is conclusive evidence for other forms of state repression. His analogies ask us to imagine Fidel and Raúl Castro as the leaders of a real-world Oceania, taking cues on how to manage a totalitarian apparatus from Big Brother. The implication is that any state seeking to control access to information, to limit perspectives on the present and the past must have other crimes to hide. This framing obscures a key feature of Cuba among twentieth-­century Communist dictatorships: its low body count. The millions who perished in Stalin’s gulags, the mass starvation in China’s Great Leap Forward and the purges of the Cultural Revolution, the killing fields of the Khmer Rouge — these instances of bloodshed have only the palest of equivalents on the island. Historically, the vast majority of the opposition to Castro’s government has been exported to the United States rather than eliminated. Amnesty International identified 120 political prisoners in Cuba in 2018, which is a lot more than none and a lot fewer than some people might assume. Orwell’s 1984 sees its protagonist being tortured. Lavoie’s only truly harrowing account of state violence in Cuba dates to the early 1960s.</p><p>In other respects, Lavoie strives for balance, avoiding blanket condemnations and probing the contradictions of some of the Miami-­based Cubans he interviews. I am tempted to attribute this position to Canadian impartiality, but it is more obviously an effect of his work as a journalist in the former Soviet Union. There, he witnessed the results of a “failed” transition to capitalism, which benefited a few oligarchs while shredding social protections. Lavoie hopes that Cuba may avoid this fate and instead move to a form of social democracy. He dedicates significant space to the contradictions of the island’s contemporary economic system, in which two currencies coexist and doctors, paid by the state, make far less than bartenders collecting tips from tourists.</p><p>Above all, Lavoie seeks to avoid the trap of romanticizing the country and, unintentionally, producing state propaganda in the process. This becomes especially clear in his portrait of Jean‑Guy Allard, a retired Québecois journalist who relocated to Havana and found himself celebrated for writing material favourable to the government. Lavoie depicts Allard as a twenty-­first-­century “useful idiot,” a term once used to describe Jean‑Paul Sartre, another former Cuba admirer. He is in declining health when Lavoie first meets him, and his subsequent death is almost allegorical — a sign that seeing the Cuban Revolution as the electrifying triumph of the 1960s is no longer tenable.</p><p>There is, however, another counterpoint to Lavoie’s take on Cuba buried within these pages. After he gives a potentially incendiary reading at Havana’s International Book Fair, an unnamed Puerto Rican writer in the audience speaks up: Lavoie must consider “capitalist totalitarianism” to fully understand the situation in Cuba and the rest of Latin America. Against the backdrop of Allard, it is easy to dismiss this anonymous writer as another useful idiot, but the comment is also a reminder of how our frames of reference determine the questions we ask.</p><p>Within Latin America, the Cuban state has long secured its legitimacy on the basis of anti-­imperialism — not Communism. Its similarities to the Soviet Union have been far less im­portant than its differences from the region’s militarized, pro-­capitalist dictatorships of the 1970s and 1980s, which frequently had U.S. backing. Caribbean and African American observers, meanwhile, have often analyzed Cuba as a former plantation economy, asking how the 1959 revolution has confronted the lingering effects of slavery and racial inequality. But Lavoie has little to say about race, a prominent subject during Obama’s visit, or about the history of U.S. intervention in the Americas. His framework remains resolutely North Atlantic; he is travelling with George Orwell, an Englishman, after all.</p><p>This is less a criticism than a reminder of all the ways in which Cuba is still “made to mean” by visitors. Allard clung to the romantic revolution, while most Canadians see a banal vacation spot. Lavoie sees an opportunity to avoid Eastern Europe’s catastrophic surrender to capitalism where others look for the fight against racism or underdevelopment. And Cubans themselves? It is to Lavoie’s credit that he concludes his book by placing the future — and the tentative hope that it may yet be brighter — in their hands.</p>",

  "content": "<p>I first saw Andy at openings at Dick Bellamy’s Green Gallery and at the Pop Art show at the Sidney Janis Gallery on October 31, 1962. It was the very first show of the original seven Pop artists — Warhol, Lichtenstein, Rosenquist, Segal, Wesselmann, Dine, and Indiana — and it so outraged and offended the old-guard Abstract Expressionists (de Kooning, Rothko, Motherwell, etc.) that they all resigned from the Janis Gallery in protest. It was the Halloween that changed art history.</p><p>Several days later with my friend the painter Wynn Chamberlain, I went to the opening of Andy Warhol’s first one-man show, at the Stable Gallery. It was right after the Cuban Missile Crisis, and everyone believed a nuclear war could actually happen at any moment. Gold Marilyn Monroe hung on the wall as you entered. This was it! Troy Donahue, Red Elvis, serial paintings of Campbell’s soup cans, Coke bottles, and dollar bills. Everyone in the art world was there.</p><p>I stood in the very crowded gallery, a little dazed. I knew it was better not to have complicated thoughts about the art, but to simply be with it. Experience it beyond concepts, in the very noisy room. We walked up to Andy, and Wynn said, “I’d like to introduce a young poet, Giorno.”</p><p>I took hold of Andy’s soft hand, which dangled from his wrist, and squeezed it. We looked in each other’s eyes. Something happened, a spark.</p><p>Over the next few months, I ran into Andy at art openings, parties, and Happenings. Sometimes I said hi to Andy, but there was almost no interaction.</p><p>Finally, in the spring of 1963, at the opening of Salvatore Scarpitta’s show at Leo Castelli Gallery (paintings of abused found objects sunk into brownish, grayish paint), Wynn said to Andy, “Come to dinner tomorrow night. John and I are going to see Yvonne Rainer at Judson Church, and we can all go together.”</p><p>Beforehand, Wynn was having this small dinner in his loft on the top floor of 222 Bowery. He invited Bobo Keely, an Upper East Side friend, Andy, and me. Wynn cooked a wonderful dinner of coq au vin. We drank wine — I more glasses than anyone, and Andy almost none — and had a good time. Andy and I were getting to know each other.</p><p>Afterward, saying good-bye, I said, “Good night, it’s so great being with you. We should get together?”</p><p>I was a little surprised at Andy’s enthusiasm. Jack had already been screening Flaming Creatures in people’s lofts, and everyone, including me, had seen it many times. It was already a cult classic. But this was the premiere, as in Hollywood premiere, which excited Andy. So, of course, I agreed.</p><p>“Here’s my telephone. Do you have a piece of paper?” Andy scribbled his number on a matchbook cover. AT9-1298. AT stood for Atwater.</p><p>“It’s so beautiful.” Andy was really interested in Jack Smith. Jack was a genius and a mess, and always fucked everything up for himself. Andy was able to take many important ideas from Jack, which then went into the making of “Andy Warhol.” Among them, Jack coined the term “superstar.”</p><p>Andy and I started going out all the time, cultivating and embracing our own peculiar vision of New York culture.</p><p>More pivotal things occurred in 1963 than any other year, except 1968, which was the end of the ’60s. In 1962, all the Pop artists had had their first one-person shows, and in 1963, they were having their second shows and becoming more established. The Judson Dance Theater happened every Wednesday night. There were countless dance and music events.</p><p>Andy and I saw each other almost every night. We spoke on the telephone every morning and made a plan. I picked him up at his townhouse on Lexington Avenue and East 89th Street, and we went together to openings, Happenings, underground movies, and parties. There were so many things going on.</p><p>It was a sweet earthquake. I still had my job on Wall Street during the day, but it soon felt like the most important part of my life was Andy. Sexually speaking, we fell into an odd pattern: When I was drunk enough, he would blow me. Or when I was still in bed hung-over, he would call, ask me what I was wearing, and then show up. It didn’t happen that often (I was going to the baths and hooking up with other people), but there was a flow of sexual energy between us.</p><p>Andy was thinking of shooting a movie called Kiss and wasn’t sure he wanted to use Naomi Levine for the tight head shot kissing ten guys. I said, “Why don’t you have two men kissing?” Andy turned slightly away and deemed it not worthy of an answer. I was a poet from the world of William Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, and we were concerned with the sexual freedom of gay men and lesbians.</p><p>“Why don’t you have two guys kissing, but like Doris Day and Rock Hudson?” Andy was silent and scornful. “Or two women?”</p><p>Andy said, “Ewww!” A week later, I asked again, and Andy sighed, “Oh, John!” which meant, Don’t you get it?</p><p>Eight years earlier, in 1955, the Bonwit Teller department store in New York had commissioned artists to create displays in its front windows on Fifth Avenue. By chance, Andy’s window was next to the window of Bob Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns; they installed them on the same night. In his design, Andy used a photograph of a gorgeous transvestite posed as a fashion model, who passed to the public as a woman.</p><p>“Bob and Jasper came and looked at what I was doing,” Andy recalled, “and laughed at me. They pointed their fingers and laughed. They were so mean!” The old-guard Abstract Expressionists had been (and still were) notoriously homophobic. Only straight guys, like themselves, were great painters. Queers, like the friends of their fag-hag wives, were not eligible. Inheriting and internalizing that loathing, gay artists like Rauschenberg and Johns didn’t talk about their sexuality and shunned homoerotic imagery in their work.</p><p>Against this, Andy was a gay man, undeniably swish, his work openly homoerotic. In the 1950s, this was daring and heroic. Andy made drawings for private view — a man’s foot and a male head with a licking tongue, and a hard dick hanging from half-opened jeans. And those made for the public were full of innuendo — portraits of drag queens, fetishistic outline drawings of sexy male feet.</p><p>Then, in 1958, he was nominated for the Tanager Gallery, an artists’ cooperative, but was turned down, rejected because he was too fey. Andy got the message and realized that being a gay artist was the kiss of death. Gay was a subculture, and a dead end; Andy wanted popular culture. To access a large commercial audience, he got rid of the gay content. In his most famous work, the homoerotic would be subverted and hidden.</p><p>That year, Jonas Mekas coined the term and invented the phenomenon called “underground cinema.” He pulled together a generation of young filmmakers by giving them venues and writing about them in his magazine, Film Culture. He rented small, run-down theaters around the city that happened to be empty for the night. Through word of mouth, everyone came. Andy and I went to the movies once, twice, or three times a week, every week for a year. There was Ron Rice’s Chumlum, Kenneth Anger’s Scorpio Rising, pieces of Ken Jacobs’s Star Spangled to Death, a rough cut of Taylor Mead in The Queen of Sheba Meets the Atom Man and The Flower Thief, both by Ron Rice. We saw them many times, as Jonas replayed them in different combinations, always putting the new film last, so we had to see the others over and over again. Andy and I saw Flaming Creatures at least 30 times. These films had an enormous impact on Andy. It was where he got the idea to make movies. He saw what film was, what it could be.</p><p>On a long weekend in late May 1963, Andy, Bob Indiana, Marisol, and I went up by train to Old Lyme, Connecticut, to visit Wynn. He had rented a farmhouse for the summer.</p><p>Eleanor Ward, owner of the Stable Gallery, who showed Andy, Bob, and Marisol in New York, rented an old stone icehouse on the same property. Wynn cooked a wonderful dinner, and we drank lots of wine. After dinner, Wynn served 140-proof black rum and I drank a lot. We said good night at about two o’clock.</p><p>Andy and I slept in a bedroom, in the same bed, but we didn’t have sex. My brain was fried by the rum. I just dropped my clothes, fell naked onto the bed, and passed out.</p><p>I woke up about 4:30 to take a piss. In the faint traces of early-morning light, Andy was next to me, his head resting on his hand and elbow, wide-awake, looking at me. I went to the bathroom, bleary-eyed, and then back to bed.</p><p>I woke up two hours later, and Andy was still looking, his eyes open wide. “What are you doing?” I was still drunk, and confused.</p><p>I took another piss and went back to sleep. I woke after a while and he was still doing it. “What are you doing?” I had a rubber tongue.</p><p>As it became lighter, I saw him more clearly. Fifteen minutes later, I turned and he was looking at me with Bette Davis eyes. I kissed him on the cheek. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“Are you sure? Take off your shirt. It’s so hot.” He declined. I tried to take it off and he giggled. Andy was wearing limp Jockey underwear. “And take off your underwear.” His skin was very white and soft, and he had hairless, beautiful boy’s legs. It was sweltering. I was wet from sweating in my sleep, so there was no thought of cuddling. I kept my eyes shut but knew he was still looking.</p><p>I woke two hours later and he wasn’t next to me. In the bright morning, he was dressed, sitting in a chair at the foot of the bed, still staring at me. “Why are you watching me?”</p><p>The next time I woke and looked, Andy was in bed with his clothes on, his head sunk in the pillow, drowsily looking at me. He was keeping himself up. It was 11:30 a.m. and sunlight came sharply into a corner of the room, heating it up to a tropical rain forest. Sweat poured from my body.</p><p>When I woke up at 1:30, Andy was gone. He was on amphetamines and had watched me sleep for eight hours. That night, Andy got the idea for the movie Sleep.</p><p>We went back to New York early on Monday afternoon. At the crowded Old Lyme railroad station, we waited interminably for the delayed Boston–New York train. Andy talked, as he often did, about making a movie, what he wanted to do, the kind of movie.</p><p>“Yes! I do!” Snuggling close, I pressed up against him like a cat. “What do I have to do? I do everything.”</p><p>“I want to be a movie star!” I said. It was the American Dream. I pronounced the words clearly with a downbeat.</p><p>“I want to be like Marilyn Monroe.” She had committed suicide only nine months earlier, on August 5, 1962. Her career was tottering, and she was the failed superstar, the union of the divine and the profane. Andy had captured that in his first Marilyn paintings, done right after her death.</p><p>In June, Andy talked a lot about shooting Sleep. One night after a party, he came by my place to check out my bed to see what it would look like on-camera. He examined the electrical outlets and figured out where he would set up the tripod.</p><p>I was sitting in a chair in the living room, and we were talking. Andy came over, sat down on the floor, and put his arm on my knee and his hand on my foot, and we continued talking and laughing. With both hands, he ran his fingers over my shoes. I was talking and not paying attention. All of a sudden, Andy’s face went down to the floor, and he was licking my shoes. He pressed his cheek to the leather and licked with his little pink tongue. Totally astonishing!</p><p>He had a secret reputation as a shoe fetishist; for years, he’d designed shoe ads for Bergdorf Goodman, I. Miller, and Bonwit Teller. There was Andy Warhol on his hands and knees, licking my Abercrombie & Fitch loafers. He wiggled his tongue around and smelled. My shoes were covered with saliva. It was a turn-on.</p><p>I got some poppers to make it better, but Andy declined. I took off my shoes and socks and Andy licked my feet and shrimped my toes. It wasn’t as erotic as it was deeply moving that he had allowed himself to do this. His sad, timid little tongue went around each toe. He seemed delicate and fragile.</p><p>Every once in a while, I went down and hugged him lovingly and kissed his face. Andy was trembling, and his heart was beating a mile a minute.</p><p>Several times I slipped my hand down and gently took hold of his dick, but he pushed my hand away. He did not want to allow anything reciprocal; maybe it frightened him.</p><p>On July 4, Andy and I went back up to Wynn’s Old Lyme farmhouse with Marisol and Bob Indiana. Wynn was giving Eleanor Ward a birthday party.</p><p>Andy also brought along his new 16-mm. Bolex. Because of the holiday, the Peerless film store had been closed so he had brought only a couple of rolls of black-and-white film. By chance, Wynn had some color film. So that weekend, Andy shot a lot in color, which he didn’t normally do. He used the film camera as if it were a still camera, which he knew how to use.</p><p>The day of the party was a hot, lazy day. We were all bored and annoyed at having to prepare for Eleanor’s birthday. I lay in a rope hammock between two trees, with my eyes closed, trying to take a nap, dazed from a hangover and the 95-degree heat. Sunlight flickered red and white on my closed eyelids, which somehow made me high. Andy was filming me from different angles. I was very comfortable with him and didn’t pay attention.</p><p>The footage of me sleeping in the hammock was beautiful — loving, very gay, everything that Andy would make sure not to include in the final cut of Sleep, which was about light and shadow. It was the one time that he could indulge himself with the pure pleasure of love. He filmed inches from my skin.</p><p>It felt like Andy was kissing or licking my skin with the camera, which is what he liked to do. He was making love to me with the camera while I slept!</p><p>We began shooting Sleep Wednesday, July 10. We had just come from a screening at the Bleecker Street Cinema and a loft party downtown. We stopped by Andy’s house and picked up the camera and lights. We got to my place and began shooting about one o’clock. I was a little drunk and made myself a vodka-and-soda. I took off my clothes, dropping them on the floor. Andy did the setup: two 150-watt aluminum reflector clip-on lights, tripod and Bolex camera, light meter and film. He was awkward and his hands trembled. He had never done it before. It was his first big film.</p><p>I lay down on the bed, sank into a soft pillow, put an arm up over my head, and closed my eyes. I liked sleeping more than anything else. The movie was Andy’s problem. I let my mind rest and fell asleep immediately.</p><p>The next morning when I woke up, I saw the apartment lights were still on, and the floor was littered with dozens of crushed yellow Kodak boxes and scraps of film. Andy and the equipment were gone. And I had a hangover.</p><p>Andy shot again two nights later, and then a handful more times over the next two weeks. If our schedules were different, I left the front door unlocked and Andy came and did it while I slept. The process had an empty and caressing quality. He’d shoot for three or four hours, until about five o’clock, when the first trace of daylight came. Andy was on speed, amphetamines, when he worked — high and wide-awake. In the dead of night, everything was crystal clear.</p><p>We started over again in August, shooting Sleep for another ten days. We looked at the film on the hand-cranked movie viewer and the clacking 16-mm. projector.</p><p>There were thousands of rolls of film, and Andy didn’t know what to do with them. Every roll was from a slightly different camera angle or had a slightly different frame or light. Andy duplicated some shots that he liked, and placed them after each other and in between other shots. He was familiar with repetition from his paintings, but this repetition was out of necessity. Andy couldn’t figure out how to make the shots into a movie.</p><p>The world premiere of Sleep was on January 17, 1964, at the Gramercy Arts Theatre on East 27th Street near Lexington. The Village Voice advertisement read: “ANDY WARHOL’S EIGHT HOUR SLEEP MOVIE. Friday, Jan. 17; Sat., 18; Sun., 19; Mon., 20. Starting 8 p.m. (one show every evening). The only New York showing for some time. Contribution: $2. Benefit show for the Film-Makers’ Cooperative.”</p><p>Sleep was a great triumph. All of New York, uptown and downtown, came or had something to say about it. “You’re a star,” said Andy. “You don’t know what I’ve done for you.”</p><p>On Halloween 1963, I went over to pick Andy up for a show, but as we got ready to leave, Andy said, “My mother wants to meet you.”</p><p>“What! … Why! … Great!” I was shocked. Nobody had ever laid eyes on Andy’s mother. He talked about her and was deeply attached to her, but she was a big secret. She lived on the ground floor, in an apartment behind the kitchen.</p><p>I was horrified. The night before, I had come back to his house, drunk, and when we said good night and walked down the stairs to the front door, we hugged and kissed, sloppy and affectionate.</p><p>Andy took me down the back stairs in the darkness, where I had never been. It was off-limits. “Let me put on the light.” Andy knocked. His mother, Mrs. Warhola, unlocked and opened the door. “Ma, this is John.”</p><p>Andy’s mother was an old woman. She had a gentle face, gray hair, a wide waist, and strong arms, and she wore a cotton floral housedress and slippers. She smiled and we laughed as we gazed at each other.</p><p>Andy and his mother talked about something in what I thought was Czech. (Later, I would learn they were not Czechoslovakian but, in fact, Carpatho Rusyn, a small ethnic group from the Carpathian Mountains.)</p><p>Listening to them talk, I realized this was a very important moment. Andy introducing me to his mother was a statement, an affirmation that we were lovers. I was thrilled that it was really true. Then I said to myself, Stop thinking stupid thoughts and just be in the moment.</p><p>“We are not exchanging gifts, but you’ve given me so much, I want to give you something. Winter solstice, New Year offerings.”</p><p>The first was a pair of fine black leather gloves from Brooks Brothers. “When broken in, they’ll go well with your black chinos.”</p><p>The second was a paper collage that I made as a Christmas card using found images, pictures from magazines, some of them pornographic, and overlaid heavily with jewels from the Tiffany catalogue. “A Rauschenberg!” laughed Andy.</p><p>The third present, wrapped in white tissue paper, was a gold wedding ring. There was a pawnshop next door to 222 Bowery, one of the last surviving ones on the street. In the window, on a blue velvet tray, were 20 or 30 old gold men’s wedding rings. They always caught my eye as I went to visit Wynn. For a Christmas present, I bought one for Andy. A thick, rich, glowing yellow-gold wedding band.</p><p>I wondered if I hadn’t made a mistake. A dead man’s wedding ring or a failed marriage, but it was too late to take back.</p><p>With a dusting of snow outside, Andy and I spent the evening together, an intimate and almost corny Christmas Eve.</p><p>I half-thought he said it to shut me up. We had shot the first Screen Test in June 1963 and would shoot the second in March 1964. But it wasn’t enough. “Another movie idea! I want to be a movie star.”</p><p>Time passed, and nothing happened. Andy was busy, and kept putting it off, and I kept saying encouragingly, “When are we going to shoot the movie?”</p><p>Andy had just rented a loft on East 47th Street, the first Factory. It was still raw industrial space, a couple of months before his friend Billy Name put silver aluminum foil and silver Mylar up everywhere. There was no heat in the building on Saturdays and Sundays, which was when Andy liked to shoot, because it was quiet.</p><p>I met Andy at three o’clock on a bleak, freezing-cold Saturday afternoon in early February. The Factory was dismal. “Where are we going to do it?”</p><p>We walked to the rear of the loft. There was a toilet, old and dirty, paint peeling off the walls, and graffiti. “A sleazy toilet! Andy, this looks gorgeous! It looks like a subway toilet.”</p><p>He set up the camera and lights. I smoked a joint and a cigarette and we talked. It was cold. Andy was ready.</p><p>He crouched down on his knees on the dirty concrete floor and sucked. He was nervous. I relaxed affectionately, to make it easy for him, and I put my hand behind his head.</p><p>But it turned out he’d run out of film and had just been shooting blanks. “I’m sorry. You looked so great. I couldn’t stop.” It augured bad things.</p><p>In April, Andy made Blow Job starring somebody else. I was deeply offended. How could he have done that? It was going to be my starring role, and he gave it to somebody else. I was devastated and furious but did not let it show. I couldn’t help but see it as a sign, an early death knell signaling the end of our relationship. That fall, Andy and I were supposed to meet at Castelli’s for a Roy Lichtenstein landscape show. When I got there, Andy had already left. My heart sank. This happened often: He would tell me a time to arrive, but when I got there, I would have just missed him.</p><p>Andy was tired of me. And the new Factory was full of new people pushing their way in front of the camera. Edie Sedgwick was center stage, and I was last year’s news.</p><p>On November 21, Andy Warhol’s show of Flower paintings opened at the Leo Castelli Gallery. It was his first show at Castelli, where he had moved after his show of Brillo boxes at the Stable Gallery in April. It was a well-calculated, political decision suggested and advised by Henry Geldzahler, a big move up.</p><p>The Flower paintings were Pop Art at its most pure. Brilliantly conceived, it was a popular image, which could be reproduced endlessly. Andy said he wanted to be a machine, all identity dropped, the individual gotten rid of, made anonymous. That night, I had arrived at Castelli alone. Andy and I no longer went out together.</p><p>He stopped answering my phone calls and didn’t call back. I wasn’t told about parties. And when I saw him, he acted like nothing had happened. It was heartache. I loved Andy. I was his first superstar, and I was the first one he got rid of.</p><p>Over the years, later superstars complained endlessly about Andy exploiting and getting rid of them. They spoke of his cruelty, his sadism. This was possibly true, as Andy was only human. It also might have been the result of the amphetamines. But at the time, I had no context. I couldn’t understand why it was happening, and I felt only suffering and pain.</p><p>On September 25, 1965, Andy gave a party for John Ashbery at the 47th Street Factory. The literary and art worlds anticipated it for a week, but I wasn’t invited and I was devastated. Everyone was there and talked about it endlessly afterward. Because I was a poet, it was a double insult.</p><p>Two weeks later, I ran into Andy at a party and he had the nerve to say, “Oh, you didn’t come to John Ashbery’s party.”</p><p>“I told Gerard to invite you.” That was it! I never called Andy again, not for years. I allowed my anger to blossom into big changes. Andy was dead for me. I almost never ran into him, and if I did, I avoided him or, of course, greeted him cheerfully and moved on.</p><p>Excerpted from Great Demon Kings, by John Giorno.

All of narrative fiction, I’ve suggested, can be sorted into four grand categories. Each presents a rich world of feeling in which any number of stories can be told and positions established, but always in relation to, or rather, driven by, a distinct cluster of values and consequent emotions. My claim is that it really is worth being aware which of these worlds we are being drawn into. We read better. We know where we are. And what the dangers are.</p><p>Where did I get this idea? The novelist and critic Raymond Williams, whose lectures I attended years ago, used to speak with fascination of the identical “structures of feeling” that he came across in quite different books. “It was a structure in the sense that you could perceive it operating in one work after another which weren’t otherwise connected—people weren’t learning it from each other; yet it was one of feeling much more than of thought—a pattern of impulses, restraints, tones.”</p><p>The discipline of systemic psychology, which owed a great deal to the work of the anthropologist Gregory Bateson, elaborated similar ideas: families, communities, individuals could be understood in relation to distinct value systems. In her influential work Permitted and Forbidden Stories, the Italian psychologist Valeria Ugazio identifies four: the first three correspond more or less to the three kinds of fiction I’ve explored: stories focused on the characters’ relations to the community (belonging), around conflicts between indulgence and renunciation (goodness), around a tension between the craving to be free and a need to feel protected (liberty). And the fourth? Here is Muriel Spark in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie; the setting is a posh school for girls in Edinburgh.</p><p>The term opened vigorously as usual. Miss Brodie stood bronzed before her class and said, “I have spent most of my summer holidays in Italy once more, and a week in London, and I have brought back a great many pictures which we can pin on the wall. Here is a Cimabue. Here is a larger formation of Mussolini’s fascisti, it is a better view of them than that of last year’s picture. They are doing splendid things as I shall tell you later. I went with my friends for an audience with the Pope. My friends kissed his ring but I thought it proper only to bend over it. I wore a long black gown with a lace mantilla and looked magnificent. In London my friends who are well-to-do—their small girl has two nurses, or nannies as they say in England—took me to visit A.A. Milne. In the hall was hung a reproduction of Botticelli’s Primavera which means The Birth of Spring. I wore my silk dress with the large red poppies, which is just right for my colouring. Mussolini is one of the greatest men in the world, far more so than Ramsay MacDonald…</p><p>There can’t be many paragraphs that bring together Cimabue, Mussolini, and A.A. Milne. But Brodie’s adolescent audience is sufficiently unsophisticated to be impressed by any name-dropping. The teacher is seducing her class, establishing her dominion over her pupils, turning them into acolytes. At the same time, she invites them to develop a broad range of cultural reference that will make them, she believes, the “crème de la crème,” hence enhancing her own reputation. “I don’t believe in talking down to girls,” Brodie announces, comparing herself to the rather motherly headmistress, who has just interrupted the lesson, “you are capable of grasping more than is generally appreciated by your elders.” Every encounter is framed in terms of competition and comparison. Brodie is always superior. Her friends kissed the pope’s ring, but she only bent over it. She knows about the great Mussolini while others pathetically admire MacDonald. “Whoever has opened the window,” she pronounces a moment later, “has opened it too wide. Six inches is perfectly adequate. More is vulgar.”</p><p>It’s hilarious. And there is an element of autobiography. The inspiration for Jean Brodie was a charismatic schoolmistress called Christina Kay. “I fell into Miss Kay’s hands at the age of eleven,” Spark later wrote, and added, “It might well be said that she fell into my hands.” This is the model for all relationships in Spark’s work, and indeed all novels in this category: you are dominated or dominant, conned or conning. Welcome to the semantics of power. “We don’t know who’s in whose hands,” complains one character in Spark’s novel The Comforters. Very often, plots hang on reversing a power relationship. There is a battle that transforms duped victim into canny victor, loser into winner. So the girl who most fell under Brodie’s sway, Sandy, is the one who, realizing that her teacher “thinks she is the God of Calvin, she sees the beginning and the end,” decides to “put a stop to her” by revealing to the headmistress that Brodie is a fascist sympathizer. The teacher is fired. An act of personal revenge is justified as a civic duty.</p><p>At a metafictional level, Spark is taking revenge on her old seductress, Christina Kay. Many of her novels were avowedly acts of vengeance on old boyfriends or employers. “Art takes revenge on life,” Luigi Pirandello observed. Yet even as Jean Brodie’s strategies of seduction are so entertainingly exposed and ridiculed, Spark is seducing us. We are invited to enjoy feeling superior to Brodie, but never to Spark, who becomes our adored, ever-brilliant instructress. Antagonists tend to be alike. Just as the betrayer, Sandy, was the girl most similar to Brodie, so when we read Spark’s essays, we find she often sounds alarmingly like her name-dropping teacher. Here she is talking of her own transformation from loser to winner in the 1950s:</p><p>The majority of those one-time [rejected manuscripts] have become a part of my oeuvre, studied in universities… I was really hungry and undernourished in those days… Graham Greene, who admired my stories, heard of my difficulties through my ex-companion; he voluntarily sent me a monthly cheque with some bottles of wine for two years to enable me to write without economic stress… I was now, also, Evelyn Waugh’s favourite author… he was generous enough to write a review of my novel in the Spectator in which he said that I had handled the subject [of hallucinations] better than he had done. </p><p>Flaunted stylistic brilliance, impressive encyclopedic knowledge, observation deployed as a weapon, and manifest complexity of composition (seeing “the beginning and the end”) are typical traits of these energetic authors, hallmarks of the superiority they have so strenuously staked out. James Joyce, Salman Rushdie, and Jonathan Franzen are prime examples. But while I struggle to find authors from earlier times to include in this category, the list from the twentieth century onward would be long: H.G. Wells, Pirandello, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Georges Simenon, Isabel Allende, V.S. Naipaul, Alice Munro, Stephen King, Elena Ferrante. If anyone is offended to find a name they worship in “inferior” company, bear with me; the distinctiveness of these categories does not prevent their being extended and varied.</p><p>Often enough early autobiographical novels portray competitive parents. Here, in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, is Stephen Dedalus’s father bragging in a pub with his son beside him:</p><p>By God, I don’t feel more than eighteen myself. There’s that son of mine there not half my age and I’m a better man than he is any day of the week.</p><p>—Draw it mild now, Dedalus. I think it’s time for you to take a back seat, said the gentleman who had spoken before.</p><p>—No, by God! asserted Mr. Dedalus. I’ll sing a tenor song against him or I’ll vault a five-barred gate against him or I’ll run with him after the hounds across the country as I did thirty years ago along with the Kerry Boy and the best man for it.</p><p>—But he’ll beat you here, said the little old man, tapping his forehead and raising his glass to drain it.</p><p>“Beat you here”—in the mind, eventually on the page—is exactly what Joyce is doing to his father in this passage. In Alice Munro’s Lives of Girls and Women, Del Jordan, the author’s alter ego, grows up in a miserable provincial town where her mother desperately seeks to distinguish herself from the losers all around her.</p><p>She joined the Great Books discussion group which… [included] a retired doctor, Dr. Comber, who was very frail, courteous, and as it turned out, dictatorial. He had pure white, silky hair and wore an ascot scarf. His wife had lived in Jubilee over thirty years and still knew hardly anybody’s name, or where the streets were. She was Hungarian. She had a magnificent name she would serve up to people sometimes, like a fish on a platter, all its silvery, scaly syllables intact, but it was no use, nobody in Jubilee could pronounce or remember it.</p><p>It’s another comedy of pretension, put into pathetic perspective by Munro’s virtuosic turn of phrase when she gives us that plattered fish with its “silvery, scaly syllables,” that no one can appreciate. The mother soon resists the dictatorial Dr. Comber and is happy to establish her own superiority when the group meets in his house and she discovers that the toilet smells. “What good is it if you read Plato and never clean your toilet?” But things turn unpleasant when she seeks to improve her position by selling encyclopedias door-to-door and gets the idea that her daughter “might be useful in her work.” Del “shared [her] mother’s appetite for reading and information.” Learning brings a sense of achievement, distinction, power.</p><p>In the front rooms of potential purchasers, the mother asks the daughter to perform, to show the value of having an encyclopedia around the house: “Name the countries and capitals of South America. The major explorers, tell where they came from and where they went. Dates too, please.” The girl loves it. “I put on a shrewd, serious, competitive look, but that was mostly for effect. Underneath I felt a bounding complacency.” She’s a winner. Until she realizes that, on the contrary, she is being exploited by a pushy mother. “One day I did not want to do it any more. The decision was physical; humiliation prickled my nerve ends and the lining of my stomach.” Del pretends she is about to vomit.</p><p>Humiliation and triumph are never far away in these novels, and always viscerally experienced. Fainting fits, panic attacks, and vomiting are commonplace. Con men abound but are often outwitted. Competitions are a regular trope, emblematic of deeper struggles: the singing competition in A Portrait of the Artist; the diving competition at the end of Tender Is the Night (in which Dick Diver disappoints); the classroom competitions in My Brilliant Friend. In Simenon’s stories about Inspector Maigret, the detective’s engagement with his criminal prey is described as a competition of wits (“You’ve won,” says the beautiful killer Else in The Night at the Crossroads, “but admit it: I put on quite a show”). Drinking, particularly heavy drinking, is always a competition, a battle with the bottle, and with one’s own weaknesses. In A Crime in Holland, the local police try to distract Maigret by inviting him to a heavy lunch with quantities of wine, where they try to sell him a false lead. He outdrinks them all and sees through their trick. But Stephen Dedalus’s father is a loser because he cannot hold his drink. Likewise, many of Fitzgerald’s protagonists.</p><p>Love relationships can be triumphs. The new couple is an exciting conspiracy against an envious world. So it is for the glamorous Dick and Nicole in Tender Is the Night, or Rushdie’s glitzy Ormus Cama and Vina Apsara in The Ground Beneath Her Feet. But soon enough, love turns into struggle. Munro’s alter ego loses her virginity with her first boyfriend, Garnet, standing up in the “peony border” outside her house. When she sees the blood between her legs, “the glory of the whole episode became clear to me.” Thrilled, she “had to mention it to somebody.” To boast. And to whom should she boast, if not to her principal antagonist, her mother?</p><p>I said to my mother, “There’s blood on the ground at the side of the house.”\n“Blood?”\n“I saw a cat yesterday tearing a bird apart. It was a big striped tom, I don’t know where it came from.”\n“Vicious beasts.”\n“You should come and look at it.”\n“What? I’ve got better things to do.”</p><p>It’s another put-down for the daughter. But soon, the lusty couple are indeed involved in a life-and-death struggle. Garnet is a born-again Christian. Del appears to have chosen him in part because he is woefully ignorant. He can’t compete. Eager to marry Del, Garnet tells her she must first be baptized. The two are swimming together in the river. She refuses. “You think you’re too good for it,” he tells her. He forces her head underwater, again and again, in a “baptism” that covers for domination. She fights back. Far from being afraid, she is merely amazed that he could have been so stupid as “to think he had real power over me.” On the contrary, it was her who “had meant to keep him sewed up in his golden lover’s skin forever.”</p><p>With this mutual realization, the relationship is over—though to lose an antagonist is hard for characters in this kind of novel, since it is only by comparing oneself, matching oneself, competing, fighting, that one achieves identity and self-esteem. Maigret always feels a certain depression when his prey is nailed and done for. Happily, a writer has the consolation that old antagonists can be resurrected and drubbed on the page, as a playful cat pats a dead bird this way and that, to hunt and kill it over and over.</p><p>Belonging. Goodness. Liberty. Power. Which is the odd man out? Our first three categories offer values that can be appreciated for themselves, separately from any relationship one may or may not have. But in the fourth, all meaning, value, and emotion springs from measuring oneself against others. Of course, terms of comparison are required. Stephen Dedalus’s father wants to beat his son at singing, jumping, and running. Stephen will beat him intellectually. Financial success is a very easy measure; money is often to the fore in these stories. Celebrity is more slippery: Is it such a victory to be admired by people who are dumb? In Simenon’s terrifying roman dur, Dirty Snow, Frank Friedmaier is determined to show he can be crueler, more violent, and more cynical than anyone else. Many of those around him don’t realize it’s a competition.</p><p>In short, in a nihilistic world, where values are not shared, it can be hard to know whether you’re winning or losing, since my antagonist’s perception of our relationship is crucial for my sense of my power over him. Or subjection to him. Frustration at not seeing one’s superiority or subservience recognized is a staple. Fortunately, novelists addressing an educated, liberal audience can reliably arouse admiration by seeming more sensitive than the norm, a quality typical of author alter egos in these novels. Or more honest. Or more morally upright. And since the medium is writing, a sophisticated way with words will always be appreciated. Of all our categories, this is the one whose authors work hardest to dress themselves in literary splendor, reducing the reader to a state of dazzled deference. When Joyce remarked that Ulysses would “keep the professors busy for centuries,” he was enjoying the same emotion Jean Brodie was looking for as she seduced her students. These authors do not think of readers as their equals.</p><p>So, whatever the value at the center of our attention, the emotions driving the action and coloring the mood are always those related to winning and losing: confidence and inadequacy, strength and weakness, complacency and resentment, envy and emulation, seducing and succumbing, jubilation, but also wise resignation. “At some far-off time he had suffered a great anguish,” reflects Naipaul’s Mr. Biswas. “He had fought against it. Now he had surrendered and this surrender had brought peace.”</p><p>This disquieting doubleness—typical, incidentally, of so much political debate—in which declared values and felt emotions seem out of sync, is at its crudest in genre fiction. Stephen King’s Bill Hodges trilogy gives us a detective’s assistant, Holly Gibney, who is a loser in all kinds of ways: dominated by an overprotective mother, suffering from Asperger’s syndrome, frail survivor of two attempts to kill herself, overweight, etc. But sweet, modest, kind. And pacifist. She refuses to carry or use a gun. Meanwhile, the loathsome Brady Hartsfield, another mother-dominated loser, is filled with resentment against a society that has rejected his talents and determined to excel in killing large numbers of people, to show the world who’s who. With elaborate contrivance, a situation is engineered where, just as Brady triumphs—“Look who wins,” he cries—the hopeless Holly grabs a gun (a “Victory .38”) and in extremis saves humankind by blowing him away. The reader rejoices; the forbidden emotion of exulting over killing has been legitimized. As for grief over the fate of innocent victims, anxiety over a possible slaughter, or repulsion at Brady’s incestuous relationship with his mother, they are barely rehearsed and certainly never felt.</p><p>Literary practitioners are more complex, perhaps conflicted. Muriel Spark, born to a working-class Jewish father and a Presbyterian mother, became a Catholic and claimed she couldn’t write novels until she did so. She spoke of a “nevertheless principle”: life was all struggle, “nevertheless,” strict rules were required to prevent you from behaving too ruthlessly, imagining you were God. But Catholicism, we remember, was also the choice of England’s literary elite, the authors Spark emulated: Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh. As well as a set of precepts, this creed is also a boast.</p><p>Salman Rushdie identifies multiculturalism as a positive value that his readers will acknowledge. And a winning strategy. Interviewed in 2005, he spoke of his anxiety as a younger man seeing very English writers like Martin Amis, Ian McEwan, and Julian Barnes getting ahead while “I was the one left in the starting gate, not knowing which way to run.” Dropping his job at an advertising agency, he decided to gamble everything on a “gigantic, all or nothing project,” and set off to India to reinforce his Indian identity. Midnight’s Children was the result. Soon enough, as he recounts in his autobiography (proudly titled Joseph Anton—after Conrad and Chekhov), he would be at the Booker Prize dinner gazing at the “handsome, leatherbound presentation copy of Midnight’s Children” with “the bookplate inside that read WINNER.”</p><p>Frequently, Rushdie’s characters look to their multicultural identity (as Spark’s do to their Catholicism) to provide strength in the fray. In The Ground Beneath Her Feet, rock star Ormus Cama “hasn’t fully grasped how to make of multiplicity an accumulating strength rather than a frittery weakness.” His breakthrough comes when he fires all the members of his band and chooses to go it alone with his own multiplicity:</p><p>What I want the music to say is that I don’t have to choose… I don’t have to be this guy or that guy, the fellow from over there or the fellow from here… I’ll be all of them, I can do that. Here comes everybody, right? That’s where it came from the idea of playing all the instruments. It was to prove that point.</p><p>Identity may be important as such, but what is felt in the novel is its importance as a way to achieve success. The fusing of Indian and British idioms are to give that constant energy and crackle that is the hallmark of Rushdie’s wilfully seductive style. His famous 1982 article, entitled “The Empire Writes Back with a Vengeance” frames postcolonial writing as vendetta.</p><p>Jonathan Franzen’s Purity deploys the most elaborate narrative machinery to set up a conflict between two very similar men, Andreas Wolf and Tom Aberant. Both run WikiLeaks-like organizations that claim to be forces for good, and both are involved in highly competitive marriages. Tom’s wife counts his and her orgasms, determined that she should have as many as he does; otherwise, she would feel like a loser. What essentially distinguishes the two men is that Andreas uses his organization to bed the women he wants and increase his power, while Tom, for all his faults, is more genuinely concerned about the world his organization was set up to help.</p><p>So we are told. In the event, it is Tom’s mooted goodness that allows him to see off Andreas in a dramatic mountain scene at the end of the book. Attempting to turn defeat into victory, Andreas asks Tom to push him off the mountain: that way, Tom, though the survivor, will be destroyed by his crime. (Spark sets up a similar plot in The Driver’s Seat.) Tom refuses, because he is good, or simply shrewder than his enemy, and Andreas kills himself. So Tom wins without having to dirty his hands, which makes him even more of a winner.</p><p>In his late Letter to My Mother, Georges Simenon suggests three kinds of victory. His mother, at the core of the book, fought all her life to escape poverty and achieve financial security, tyrannizing everyone around her, most of all her first husband, Simenon’s father, whom she despised for his low earnings. But he was always serene and happy in himself, Simenon observes, while she, despite reaching her goal, “always suffered life, never lived it.” “My father lacked nothing, my mother lacked everything,” he reflects. Finally, there was Simenon himself, who claimed to “have had sex with 10,000 women,” and was one of the highest-paid writers of his time, but who failed to win the Nobel Prize, as he had confidently predicted he would, whose marriages ended badly, and whose daughter committed suicide.</p><p>Who is the winner here? Simenon tries to resolve the question with a gesture of understanding. “Don’t imagine, Mother, that I bear you any grudge, or that I judge you. I don’t judge anyone. If men have always fought each other since time began, it is out of their failure to understand their neighbours.” This sounds wise and sensitive, but the attentive reader might also detect the smell of moral superiority that makes victory complete. As one character says to her mother at the end of Purity, “Weak people hold grudges, Mom. Strong people forgive… You got everything you wanted. You won!”</p><p>Other writers renounce victory, seek out defeat. In Six Characters in Search of an Author, Pirandello supposes a situation where, weary of succumbing to the dictates of his characters, an author abandons the struggle, leaving them to fight it out between themselves and the actors they hope will represent them. Old hierarchies are overwhelmed by a free-for-all of competing egos. Robert Walser inverts the terms of the game entirely, imagining, in Jakob von Gunten, a surreal school of self-annulment where pupils learn to think of nothing and serve others blindly without asking any questions. Dumbest is best. Appalled with his own early ambitions, Walser retired to a mental home intent on “disappearing as discreetly as possible.” When Carl Seelig, visiting, assured him he was one of the greatest authors of his time, Walser told his friend he must never say anything of the kind again, or their relationship was over. Self-annulment, too, is a form of victory.</p><p>The most celebrated novel in this category is undoubtedly Ulysses, offering the full range of possible positions in this world of feeling. In the opening pages, Stephen Dedalus measures himself against Buck Mulligan in a battle of wits, then teams up with him to outwit the Englishman Haines, in hopes of getting some money out of him, then resents the dairy woman for respecting Buck more than him because Buck is a medical student, resents England for dominating Ireland, resents the headmaster at the school where he teaches for paying him so little and asking him to run errands, and resents his students for being rich and ignorant, focusing his lesson on the concept of the Pyrrhic victory. Stephen is wittier and more sensitive than others, and competitive, but he can’t compete on their terms: money and social standing.</p><p>Conversely, Leopold Bloom is introduced in the subservient act of making breakfast for his unfaithful wife. But generously, resignedly. A Walser figure. With a sense of curiosity and fun, he measures himself against the cat. “Wonder what I look like to her. Height of a tower? No, she can jump me.” Here, too, he is put in his place. Submissively, he takes a tray up to Molly in bed and picks up a book she has dropped by the chamber pot. She complains about a word she doesn’t understand, “metempsychosis.” Now, still serving her, he can show his superior intellect by explaining. Later, sitting on the toilet, he is unimpressed by a short story in the newspaper, but “envied kindly Mr. Beaufoy who had written it and received payment.” Then he tears up the paper and wipes himself with it. </p><p>In many ways a defeated man, Bloom has chosen not to compete: he lives in that peace after struggle described by Mr. Biswas, retreating into the pleasures of his voyeurism and encyclopedic musings. It’s wonderfully attractive. For Joyce himself, those musings are turned into an instrument of sensational success. Retreating himself from Ireland and the ordinary fray, but continuing to compare himself with old antagonists back home, Joyce sought out new literary territories where only he could shine. The end result was the brilliantly unreadable Finnegans Wake, a project that fused self-affirmation with withdrawal into a private world. Writing it, he would recite passages to friends and ask if they understood; if they did, he rewrote them to make things more difficult.</p><p>Once, talking to the novelist David Lodge, I expressed my impatience with the book, which he was then teaching at university. “Whatever you think,” he replied, “you can’t deny it was a winning strategy.” Joyce draws us to think in those terms, and to try ourselves against the challenge he set. Courses on the Wake, Lodge added, were always oversubscribed.</p>",

  "content": "<p>At the peak of the coronavirus crisis in March, Americans received an instructive lesson in different forms of political authority. Every afternoon, President Trump deployed his usual brazen, off-the-cuff confidence about drinking bleach and reopening businesses, turning his crisis press conferences, like everything he touches, into a reality TV show in which he is the star. Meanwhile, the portion of the public not enthralled by Trump’s act—and perhaps even some who were—found a contrasting form of leadership in figures like Anthony Fauci, whose sober assessment of the threat and straightforward advice about saving lives inspired such adulation that Americans were soon learning about his high school basketball career.</p><p>Other than a podium, the thing that united these men at that moment was their charisma. Each had a charismatic relationship with a community of followers who believed their leader’s extraordinary qualities would save them from a crisis. To be sure, Trump and Fauci used their power to contrasting ends—but according to Princeton historian David Bell, that is a built-in danger of charismatic authority, one that Bell believes is inextricably entwined in modern democratic politics. “A potentially authoritarian charisma is as modern a phenomenon as any of the liberal ideas and practices that arose in the age of revolution,” he writes in his new book Men on Horseback: The Power of Charisma in the Age of Revolution.</p><p>Anyone concerned with the question of charismatic political leaders necessarily stands in the shadow of Max Weber, the great German sociologist who wrote sketches of the subject not long before his death, a century ago, from a case of pneumonia brought on by the Spanish flu. For Weber, charisma was one of three basic forms of political authority, along with traditional rule based on custom and rational rule based on law and bureaucracy. Yet while traditional and rational rule both aimed, despite their differences, at securing the foundations for everyday life by providing permanent structures to satisfy ordinary needs with ordinary means, charismatic rule was strikingly different. It involved the “personal devotion” of a group of followers to a leader whom they “considered extraordinary and treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional powers or qualities.” Suited expressly for extraordinary situations—“arising out of enthusiasm, or of despair or hope,” as Weber put it—charismatic authority was inherently unstable. It was, in fact, “a specifically revolutionary force” that “transforms all values and breaks all traditional and rational norms.” “In traditionalist periods,” he added, “charisma is the great revolutionary force.”</p><p>Bell adopts Weber’s conception of charismatic authority and his notion of it as a revolutionary force. Rather than examining it as an abstract type, however, Bell is interested in what charisma looked like at a particular time and place: the “Age of Revolution,” which rippled across the Atlantic world from roughly 1775 to 1825. First in North America, then France, then Haiti, then South America, people rebelled against their rulers and, following charismatic revolutionary leaders, established new states. In a series of chapters focusing on George Washington, Napoleon, Toussaint Louverture and Simón Bolívar—the titular “men on horseback”—Bell examines the nature of each man’s charisma, the means of its propagation, the extent of its reach and its ultimate political result. His purpose, broadly speaking, is to assess the role of charisma in modern political culture while also outlining a new interpretation of the age of supposedly democratic revolutions. Donald Trump is never mentioned by name—he is once called “the victorious candidate” in the 2016 election—but his specter haunts the book as Bell makes the case that there is, and always has been, a vanishingly thin line between charismatic democratic rulers and charismatic authoritarians.</p><p>The charismatic model of political leadership that Bell is interested in was made possible, he believes, by Enlightenment-era ideas and cultural changes that took shape in the generation or two before his first case study begins, with Pasquale Paoli, the leader of Corsica in the 1750s and 1760s. Bell passes quickly over the political ideas. Popular sovereignty was a key concept because it placed the ultimate source of political authority in the people, but that alone, he says, cannot account for the rise of charismatic leaders. The main story, for him, has to do with cultural changes involving secularization and celebrity. First, as the scientific advances of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries made God seem increasingly remote from individual lives, people’s desire for a connection to supernatural forces was displaced onto nature, finding one home in a new fascination with geniuses who had been endowed by nature with extraordinary abilities. Meanwhile, an explosion of print after 1700 meant that people had increasingly easy access to novels and newspapers. Sentimental novels, in particular, trained readers to develop a deep emotional relationship with characters.</p><p>By the end of the 1700s, their techniques had been translated into a new style of biography focusing on the individuality and private life of living people, complete with anecdotes of intimate moments with family and friends. These sentimental biographies combined with other products of the print revolution, like periodicals and engravings, to give birth to celebrity culture. All these changes, Bell writes, “taking place in tandem with the spread of belief in popular sovereignty, created the possibility for ordinary people to see political figures in a radically new way. They could now imagine that they knew these figures personally and intimately and could feel a powerful emotional connection to them—a connection heightened by their sense of the figures’ sublime, transcendent, extraordinary qualities.” Modern charismatic political leadership—of a kind we can still recognize today—was born.</p><p>Bell uses Paoli’s broader fame throughout Europe and the Americas to show how print culture enabled charismatic political models to spread around the Atlantic world. After taking power in 1755, Paoli developed a written constitution for Corsica, resolved disputes among local clans, reorganized the government, and established a university. But all that would have remained a provincial story if not for the publication of James Boswell’s Account of Corsica, which included “memoirs of Pasquale Paoli,” in 1768. As he did more famously in his later Life of Samuel Johnson, Boswell provided intimate portrayals and effusive praise of his leading man. “I was glad to have an opportunity of seeing him in those teasing moments, when,” Boswell wrote, “according to the Duke de la Rochefoucault, no man is a hero to his valet de chambre.” Despite being privy to such moments, Boswell concluded, “I saw my highest ideal realized.” Then as now, access to supposedly unscripted moments of authenticity could secure the devotion of writers as well as readers.</p><p>Boswell’s book was a big success, selling seven thousand copies in Britain and being translated into several other languages. Widely reviewed and praised, it launched a torrent of Paoli-related material in the British press: there were poems called The Paoliad and recipes for things like “Chicken Paoli.” Paoli’s fame in Britain declined after 1769, when Corsica was crushed by the French, but his legend lived on in British North America, where he provided a potent “symbol of resistance,” Bell notes, for a set of colonies in the early stages of its own struggle against an overseas overlord. “The charismatic reputation Paoli developed elsewhere in the Western world,” Bell writes, “demonstrated the power of print fervently to attach a far-flung set of admirers to a previously unknown, charismatic figure.”</p><p>According to Bell, Paoli’s model helped other societies envision a new form of charismatic political leadership, and the revolutions that took place over the next fifty years provided plenty of opportunities for charismatic leaders to emerge and be embraced by newly empowered peoples. Bell’s individual portraits of these charismatic revolutionary leaders build to a broader interpretation of the age of democratic revolutions as a whole.</p><p>Ever since the French Revolution started in 1789, the nature of one revolution’s influence on another has been an open question. Sometimes the American Revolution is severed from the revolutionary sequence as sui generis and somehow intellectually impotent despite its success, as in Hannah Arendt’s contention that it “has remained an event of little more than local importance.” Bell believes it did have an influence, just not in the ideas or Constitution the revolutionaries had fought for. “Astonishingly,” he notes, proving part of Arendt’s point, “not once in the early years of the French Revolution does a single political figure seem to have quoted the American Declaration of Independence.” The lines of influence, Bell asserts, occurred rather in models of political leadership. “What impressed Europeans,” he writes, “was not specific American political arrangements so much as exemplary American men, above all Benjamin Franklin and George Washington.” Like Paoli before them, they provided a model of republicanism in action for later leaders like Napoleon and Toussaint Louverture, and that model proved relevant across national borders because the Atlantic world constituted a coherent political community. By the time Bolívar was at work in Spanish America in the 1810s, Bell says, the revolutionary experiences of the United States, France and Haiti meant that “charismatic leadership had become a dominant feature of political life throughout the Atlantic world.”</p><p>Bell’s book is narrative, not comparative, and it focuses on shared models, not distinct ideas, so it sometimes has the effect of smushing all the revolutions together into one undifferentiated mass. There are variations depending on the character of the leader and the conditions of his country, but Bell’s chapters can start to feel repetitive as he diligently describes each man’s rise to power and the spread of his charismatic reputation. Indeed, that repetitiveness is part of the point, since Bell wants to show how charismatic models were copied and adapted over time. There is always a major crisis in which the charismatic leader proves himself and saves his country through an audacious display of military skill: Washington crossing the Delaware, Napoleon crossing the Alps, Bolívar crossing the Andes. The people celebrate their savior and his extraordinary qualities in news reports, poems and plays, which spread his renown throughout the Atlantic world. Toasts are made; towns, ships and children are named for the hero. There are celebratory parades, often including triumphal arches and young women clad in white. At some point the military hero becomes a political leader.</p><p>By basing political legitimacy in a direct, personal connection to the people, Bell notes, this new style of leader could actually achieve greater power than traditional rulers bound by the constraints of honor and tradition. Whatever democratic ideas the leader once espoused fade into the past as he makes himself ruler for life; the age of democratic revolutions resulted in few successful democracies. At the same time, the charismatic leader inevitably faces the problem of how to sustain his charismatic authority, which is central to his power and, by now, his increasingly egotistical self-conception. Propaganda helps, but not forever. Military defeat or the decline of popular support means the leader’s end comes early, and he ends up dying alone, in exile.</p><p>In France, Haiti and South America, charismatic revolutionary leaders gave way to a string of emperors, dictators and military strongmen. Washington is the great exception to this general scheme. What happened to his charisma after his death? Bell largely agrees with other scholars who have claimed that it became embedded in the American presidency, where the Constitution domesticated it for everyday use. And he believes that charisma has been kept alive to this day as a regular feature of politics not only in America but throughout the world. “Charisma is an integral, inescapable part of modern political life—democracy’s shadow self,” he writes. “Its modern forms arose out of the same cultural and intellectual universe that gave birth, in the age of revolution, to modern constitutional, democratic regimes.” Bell proves the worth of this insight in a variety of asides that illuminate everything from why it’s hard for female leaders to benefit from their charisma (love from male citizens easily shades into indecent erotic desire) to why nearly all contemporary leaders make rhetorical appeals to rebirth (charisma, however attenuated, remains revolutionary at heart).</p><p>Beyond that, Bell’s history can help us assess the dangers facing democracy today. Do democracies stand on anything more solid than the quicksand of popular love for a leader? Nearly all leaders, however virtuous, can be too easily corrupted by their own love of being loved, as Bell’s book and elementary human experience prove. Moreover, the essence of love as an emotion undermines the possibility of making rational choices about our rulers and regimes. As Hannah Arendt pointed out long ago in On Revolution, emotions like love and compassion abolish “the worldly space between men where political matters, the whole realm of human affairs, are located.” She believed that passionate emotions like love necessarily “shun the drawn-out wearisome processes of persuasion, negotiation, and compromise, which are the processes of law and politics,” because they can only take immediate action, not engage in argumentative speech. (This holds equally, it should be noted, for rage and hate.)</p><p>Bell’s book amounts to a demonstration of this insight, showing how charisma works to abolish the distance between a people and their leader by forging the sense of intimate connection. And Bell is well aware that the internet and social media have made it even easier than before to abolish distance by warping political figures into friends whose photos and tweets appear in your feed. He knows that it is inevitable, perhaps now more than ever, for many charismatic leaders to fall on the authoritarian side of the scale.</p><p>Yet he has learned from history that we can’t simply jettison charisma. Nor, he thinks, should we want to. The existence of leaders like Trump, Putin, Modi and Duterte “should not discredit the use of a charismatic politics for democratic, liberal ends,” he argues, because fighting for democracy “requires more than principles and causes—it requires leaders who can elicit emotions powerful enough to impel people to action.” After all, Bernie Sanders is also a charismatic figure. Having accepted the inevitability and even desirability of charismatic leaders in modern politics, Bell ends with an enjoinder “to choose these charismatic leaders wisely, by judging as carefully as possible both the individuals themselves and the causes for which they stand.”</p><p>This registers as a somewhat weak conclusion in the face of the revolutionary power that Bell has shown charismatic authority to have, especially given that he doesn’t directly define the criteria we should be using to judge wisely. But his book contains an implicit answer in the form of George Washington, who appears as clearly the most admirable of the men under consideration. Granted, a variety of factors played into this result. The United States was not beset on all sides by counterrevolutionary forces, like France, nor was it subject to the decades of hatred and fear that greeted Haiti’s multiracial republic. Instead, it was singularly lucky to have an isolated, prosperous, relatively equal society (among free people) that already had more than a century of experience with self-government.</p><p>But the United States also chose George Washington as its leader. Bell shows Bonaparte, Louverture and Bolívar starting to assert their own destiny to rule and ultimately believing in their own superiority to others. In stark contrast, Washington resisted the temptation to buy into his own legend and voluntarily laid down his power twice rather than becoming ruler for life. Bell attributes some of this to the American Revolution’s success, which, uniquely among the revolutions he discusses, “allowed for the survival into peacetime of an unquestionably legitimate and undivided civilian government.” Yet he also allows that Washington’s character played a crucial role. “His charismatic reputation in 1789 constituted a potential political weapon of enormous power,” he notes. “A Bonaparte would not have hesitated to use it. Washington never did.”</p><p>Instead of exploiting his charismatic legend for his personal aggrandizement, Washington deployed it strategically to bestow authority on the Constitutional Convention and then to shape the new government. Historically, our best political leaders have worked in the same way. Like all charismatic leaders, they paid close attention to their public image (Washington’s reserve, Lincoln’s beard, FDR’s wheelchair), but saving the country depended not on their special abilities as uniquely endowed saviors, but on their capacity for reminding Americans that self-government was at stake. To the extent that we love them, we love them less as individuals than as representations of what it means to work toward a more perfect union. When we set them up in stone, it is because they were servants of something higher than themselves.</p>",

  "content": "<p>Free speech is in danger, many liberals warn. In traditional and social media, and in institutions such as universities, the limits of acceptable discussion seem to be growing ever narrower. Uncomfortably for liberals, the threat comes not so much from the state, the usual target of liberal critique, as from a portion of civil society. Increasingly many of our friends, neighbors, and fellow citizens, especially within the professional classes, no longer profess to believe that free speech is valuable—or even that it exists.</p><p>One of the leading intellectual figures in this shift of American opinion is Stanley Fish. Trained as a scholar of the 17th-century poet John Milton, Fish has for the past three decades been one of the country’s sharpest critics of free speech and of liberalism more generally. In his 1994 book, There’s No Such Thing as Free Speech, and It’s a Good Thing, Too, Fish pointed to many aspects of how speech works that liberals prefer to ignore—and offered a challenging new perspective on the origins of liberalism.</p><p>In an insightful interpretation of Milton’s 1644 pamphlet Areopagitica, one of the most famous statements against censorship of the press, Fish argued that liberal understandings of free speech are shallow and incoherent. Free speech depends on an unacknowledged spiritual tradition, he insisted, and can only make sense within it.</p><p>Fish began the titular essay of There’s No Such Thing as Free Speech by observing that “the concept of free speech” was falling out of favor with the left. In the 1960s and ’70s, supporting free speech had served the leftist efforts to lift restrictions on expressions of radical politics, sexuality, and the perspectives of minority groups. By the 1990s, however, claims about “free speech” seemed to have become a weapon by which conservatives shielded themselves from accusations of racism, sexism, homophobia, and xenophobia.</p><p>Fish did not call on leftists to congratulate themselves on this moral victory, by which they had convinced conservatives of the value of free speech. Nor did he urge them to consider how the right’s change of heart might have been a response to the left’s growing cultural power. Instead, he insisted that this shift had revealed free speech for what it was: an empty placeholder for political interests.</p><p>When we think about free speech, we perhaps have in mind some notion of passionate debate. But if we look at what people in practice do with the term “free speech,” Fish argued, we see that is a label we give to ways of speaking that we happen to like. It is “just the name we give to verbal behavior that serves the substantive agendas we wish to advance.” Speech that we do not like, no matter how courageous or thoughtful, does not seem to us like free speech. Instead, it seems like hatred, ignorance, and even the silencing of debate.</p><p>Fish’s observation may seem flippant and cynical. But debate inspired by the recent open letter on free speech published in Harper’s confirms his point—and the influence that views like his have in contemporary American culture. While the letter’s signatories tried to uphold general principles of free speech “against the intolerant climate that has set in on all sides,” they were perceived by many commentators as partisan actors. The moral standing and supposed agendas of individual signatories were scrutinized and fiercely anathematized on social media, where they were often depicted as privileged elites bent on silencing critical minority voices.</p><p>From the perspective that Fish offers, such responses should not be seen as expressing simply the mean-spiritedness or hypocrisy of individual commentators. Each of us only means by “free speech” the views that we happen to endorse, and each of us sees disagreement with those views as malicious, agenda-driven silencing. This is the structure of our experience of speech, which liberal principles disguise but cannot change. Whenever we try to apply those principles in specific cases, we find ourselves giving them a partisan content. We find ourselves saying that some kinds of speech do not deserve to be free.</p><p>To prove that his claim that our trouble lies in the concept of free speech itself and not in the failings of its modern-day defenders, Fish turned readers’ attention to the Areopagitica. Written by Milton in 1644 to plead with the English Parliament against censorship of books, the Areopagitica has become a central text in Western political theory. Reaching far beyond the specific issue of state censorship, Milton argued that open, courageous debate was vital to the politics, culture, and morality of a free society. Except, Fish noted, that just before concluding his immortal defense of liberal principles “Milton catches himself up short and says, of course, I didn’t mean Catholics, them we exterminate.”</p><p>Milton was writing in the midst of a political and religious revolution in England that had overthrown the monarchy and church hierarchy. In his day, as religious wars raged throughout Christian Europe, the Catholic Church appeared to be a threat to truth. From Milton’s perspective, the Church prevented believers from reading the Bible and forced them to follow the teachings of priests. Milton excluded Catholics from the community of those who ought to enjoy free speech not so much because their specific doctrinal beliefs were different from those of Protestants, but because they believed something different about the nature of truth: that it could be enforced through coercion. For Milton, truth cannot be transmitted at the point of a gun. Holding a belief—even a correct belief—because one is too afraid not to is not living in truth. It is “heresy.” Free speech is reserved for those who keep the faith that people can find and share truth without recourse to force.</p><p>Stanley Fish argued that even when all seems well, the lesson of history seems to be that Jews must be wary of possible threats. These include the dangers of speech.</p><p>Whatever the merits of revolutionary Protestantism, Milton was right about the nature of free speech, Fish insisted. We allow speech to be free within a particular community in order to achieve some particular end. Free speech is “produced within the precincts of some concept of the good,” a good that must be protected from its enemies through an act of “originary exclusion.” Because our society (any society) is oriented toward some substantive notion of the good, there are points of views that, if allowed to express themselves, would “undermine the very purposes for which our society is constituted.” Speech has effects on human minds, incites action and shapes society. If we were to allow any kind of speech whatsoever, that would mean we didn’t care about these effects, that we were happy to live in any kind of society whatsoever.</p><p>Liberals sometimes allow a weakened version of this idea by accepting that “the intolerant” should be silenced, but they are reluctant to conceive of society as having a purpose greater than the contingent goals of individuals. They are, moreover, ill at ease with the implications of speech having effects. While liberals often claim to want energetic debates about politics and values, they also seem to want such speech to be a kind of riskless thrill in which supposedly dangerous ideas are tossed around and then returned safely to the realm of theory at the end of staged conversations. They shrink back from Milton and Fish’s insights.</p><p>But we can no longer afford this intellectual cowardice, or the false courage of self-styled independent thinkers. We must confront the questions Milton and Fish pose: If free speech is always for some purpose or another, always doing something or another, always excluding someone or another, then how should we speak—and how should we speak about speech?</p><p>Having used Milton to demolish liberal views of free speech, Fish argued that the Areopagitica does not provide a model of how to give purpose—and limits—to speech today. While Milton revealed that “free speech” is oriented around the “common good” of a specific community, excluding the enemies of that good, his notion of the good was a “specifically religious” one. The modern United States, however, is a secular country. In what may seem like a paradox, Fish argued that this means Americans today will find Milton’s limited vision of free speech far too tolerant.</p><p>Members of Milton’s religious community could believe that their debates, guided by the spirit of God, would lead them to truth. This confidence in the ability of believers to understand Scripture, argue over it in a brotherly way, and advance toward a greater knowledge of divine things, “is indeed the whole of Christianity,” Fish said. But if we do not have such a faith that we are progressing toward truth—if indeed we doubt that there is such a thing as truth—then even allowing limited debates for limited purposes may seem dangerous.</p><p>The modern-day equivalents of Milton’s Catholics are not, for the most part, actual Catholics (though there are, to be sure, militantly illiberal Catholics). Rather, they are adherents of a new political spirituality for which we do not yet have an adequate name. They do not (yet) control the highest levels of government, but they evidently wield considerable power within state, corporate, and cultural institutions. In articles, in Twitter mobs, and in everyday conversations, they are reshaping our consensus about what counts as a legitimate opinion and what sort of ideas should be allowed to appear in the public sphere.</p><p>Inspired by critiques of free speech and of liberalism developed by thinkers like Fish, woke believers have made harm, vulnerability, history, and power into norms that set the terms of discourse. They do not believe that truth is something that we can find together, but rather that it is something they possess and can impose on others. For liberals who are prepared to abandon the illusions of free speech absolutism, it can be said that these believers do not constitute one side of a national debate but are the enemies of debate itself. Free speech can only begin when they have been defeated.</p><p>There is no perspective from which secular leftists can “endure whatever pain racist and hate speech inflicts for the sake of a future whose emergence we can only take on faith,” Fish warned. There is for them no truth on the horizon that could justify open political debate on sensitive questions, even with the sort of qualifications and exceptions that Milton made. Why allow disagreement at all if there is no truth to be discovered, only moral certainties to be perpetuated?</p><p>Taking from Milton a sense that free speech must have goals and limits, but abandoning his confidence that debates can produce truth, Fish founded his own conception of the politics of speech on the idea that we ought to avoid harm. This idea has now become common sense in much of American culture. Expressing doubt about the efficacy and ethics of diversity politics, questioning slogans like Black Lives Matter and Defund the Police, or worrying about the implications of gender reassignment therapies for children are all conflated with doing physical harm to actual people. It is difficult to discern whether the fear is that such doubts and worries, aired in public, might embolden violent bigots—or whether disagreement about the legitimacy of certain causes is, by its very nature, a kind of violence.</p><p>In shifting the focus from the truth that speech might discover to the harm that it might cause, Fish was informed by his sense of belonging to a vulnerable group. In his 1989 book Doing What Comes Naturally: Change, Rhetoric and the Practice of Theory in Literary and Legal Studies, he remarked that, having been born in 1938, “I am old enough to remember when it was not a simple matter to be both an academic and a Jew (now almost an identification).”</p><p>Coming of age when WASPish anti-Semitism was still a fact of life at many leading American universities, Fish did not take his presence in academia for granted. Nor, he observed in a 2007 blogpost for The New York Times, could he take for granted his safety in America. Entitled, “Is It Good for the Jews?” it recalls that this had been the central question of debates among friends and family as Fish was growing up in the 1940s and ’50s. While colleagues born after WWII might find it paranoid to track political developments in the United States today with that same fraught question, Fish argued that even when all seems well, the lesson of history seems to be that Jews must be wary of possible threats. These include the dangers of speech.</p><p>The principle of free speech might seem appealing to minorities and other vulnerable groups. But Fish warned that it is an instrument by which the privileged silence criticism. Individuals appeal to “such words and phrases as part of an effort to deprive moral and legal problems of their histories.”</p><p>When we insist that someone should be allowed to express harmful views, we are not merely upholding a neutral principle that the right to speak freely should be available to everyone. To think about the issue in these terms is to ignore that such speech strengthens the bigot and weakens his targets. Claims about universal rights ignore the “history” and “power” that are at play in any particular case. Paying attention to the latter means realizing that there can be no easy “neutrality.”</p><p>Fish’s critique of the concept of free speech challenges the foundations of liberalism. Free speech allows us, many liberals think, to debate issues in a rational way, using arguments rather than force to create consensus. This is because liberals understand speech as something outside politics, something fundamentally different from the physical force and coercion inherent to action on the part of the state. If, however, we recognize that power and history always operate in all of domains of life, and that we are always involved in ongoing struggles, then liberal perspectives seem to be the hopes of idealistic fools or the hypocritical alibis of the powerful.</p><p>Many today endorse something like Fish’s damning account of liberalism. One often hears that neutrality is impossible, that silence is violence, that liberal attempts to treat people equally ignore histories of oppression. But the specific histories and inequalities of power that motivated Fish’s account do not seem to speak to today’s post-liberal thinkers and activists. Thinking from a vantage of Jewish vulnerability, Fish turned to Israel as an example of the importance of sacrificing liberal principle to focus on power, history, and harm.</p><p>In his 1993 essay “Reverse Racism, or How the Pot Got to Call the Kettle Black” (included in There’s No Such Thing and first appearing in The Atlantic), Fish noted that some critics of Zionism equate Israel to other regimes based on ethnic and racial exclusion, such as Nazi Germany. These comparisons are outrageous, Fish answered, because they treat violations of a common abstract principle (states should not be founded on ethnic discrimination) as equivalent, ignoring the histories and power relations that make such different violations incomparable. The Aryan state was a genocidal regime based on oppression; the Jewish state is a haven from oppression. The present-day state of debate over Israel, however, shows that by appealing to histories of vulnerability and powerlessness, rival groups can make opposing political demands—with each calling for its opponents to be silenced.</p><p>It should not be difficult to imagine that claims about historical victimhood can be used to advance oppressive agendas: The invocation of a collective victimhood that must be defended against and/or avenged is a rhetorical staple of nearly every modern-day tyranny, both great and small. Therefore, anyone trying to use Fish’s ideas for deciding what speech should be permitted will have a difficult task. One would have to conduct an investigation into history, tracing power relations and weighing up accumulated wrongs. This would put one in the position of being a neutral arbiter not much different from that of someone upholding liberal principles of free speech. In both cases, one assumes the right to be a third party and evaluate claims on the basis of criteria that are not those of either partisan “side.”</p><p>Undoing liberals’ illusory conceptions of free speech to reveal the workings of history and power, as Fish called for, does not in fact make politics simpler or safer. Instead of accusing each other of violating the principle of free speech, rival groups can accuse each other of ignoring history and doing harm, with each presenting itself as a victim. Political partisanship remains as hypocritical as it was under liberalism, and still requires, above the fray, a neutral third party committed to truth—with the difference that ideas of neutrality and truth now seem to have no higher intellectual foundation. It is hard to imagine how such a state of affairs is “good for the Jews,” or for anyone else.</p><p>Yet if Fish’s solution is no solution at all, his critique of free speech and liberalism remains insightful. Liberalism often appears to be a kind of game in which we pretend to see situations other than they are. Liberals choose to ignore history, power, inequality, and vulnerability under certain circumstances. They choose to ignore the potential violence in certain words. They choose to imagine that their interlocutors are committed to a search for truth. These are always strategic, self-interested, political choices.</p><p>Liberalism is a wager that, by strategically ignoring some features of reality, liberals can build a decent society that offers relative safety and freedom to its members—while constantly pointing these features out would only excite partisan passions, endangering the foundation of society. Liberals, by these lights, are not the naive fools that Fish takes them for. Rather, they are calculating hypocrites who believe that their deceptions are superior to Fish’s dangerous and self-defeating truths.</p><p>Such a defense of liberalism and its conception of free speech could be constructed in answer to Fish’s critique. Cynical and sober, its proponents would know that “free speech” doesn’t really mean anything, and that speech really can hurt people. They would also know, although perhaps they would refuse to admit, that some kinds of speech must therefore be banned. If we are committed to living in a certain kind of society—one that allows people to flourish in their autonomy—then speech that undermines this goal must be (quietly and hypocritically) silenced.</p><p>A politics informed by a purely pragmatic conception of free speech would be a kind of Cold War liberalism for today’s culture wars. Rather than promoting a “common good,” it would try, with Machiavellian cunning and deceit, to protect the possibility of quiet, ordinary, nonpolitical life, founded on illusion, from the crushing intensity of politics.</p><p>But can we do better than that? Perhaps, returning to Milton, we can. Fish argued that the Areopagitica does not offer a model for contemporary American politics, because we no longer share Milton’s faith. Unless we are united by a spiritual connection, in agreement on common beliefs and oriented toward a shared goal, how can we hope to find truth through discussion? Why would we put up with all the discomforts and dangers of free speech?</p><p>Let us consider what Milton said about the relationship between truth and spirituality. He argued that although God has revealed to us moral obligations, He has also given us “the gift of reason” and the “freedom to choose, for reason is but choosing,” so that we can discover for ourselves how to fulfill them. To choose well, we must acquire truth, including knowledge “of evil.”</p><p>Searching for truth involves reading books by pagan, heretical, and wicked authors. We must be prepared for truth to come from even more unexpected sources. God has sent prophets in the past and may send others in the future. Both by reading nonbelievers and listening to possible prophets, we can acquire deeper insights into Scripture. But, whenever they come, such new insights produce debate. After all, Milton reminded readers, Christianity itself “was once a schism” within Judaism. Free speech will involve not only engagement with people who believe differently than we do, but a perpetual openness to challenges and transformation that may lead us to change our beliefs.</p><p>Pursuing the truth is necessary to our spiritual lives, because without it we cannot be the autonomous moral agents that God desires us to be. We cannot pursue the truth alone—we must enter into discussion with all sorts of people, including those who may create dangerous “schisms.” Some of these people will bring us new truth, and others, by challenging us to give new reasons for the truths we already possess, will help us acquire “true knowledge of what we seem to know.” Our disagreements with these people are likely to be vigorous and disturbing, but if we avoid them, then we will lose hold not only of our spiritual freedom, but also of our tradition.</p><p>Milton warned that if we are in thoughtless “conformity” with custom and refuse to address the challenges posed to it by heretics, possible prophets, and other interlocutors, then we will descend into a kind of “heresy” that consists of believing without a rational basis. At the same time, he claimed, our religious traditions are full of ideas that have become shocking by today’s standards. The great thinkers of the past wrote with “dash” and “venturous edge” that upset many modern readers’ “low decrepit humor.”</p><p>The Bible itself is full of scenes of depravity, violence and expressions of heresy and atheism. Many, Milton noted, would prefer receiving some bowdlerized official teaching extracted from the Bible rather than confront the offensive material and troubling mysteries of the text itself. Being authentically spiritual and being authentically traditional both demand that we not only tolerate, but practice and seek out, free speech, grappling with what disturbs us most in our own history.</p><p>We are not 17th-century Protestant revolutionaries. But a spiritual community like the one Milton imagined does not need to be specifically Protestant, Christian, or even theistic. All that seems to be necessary is that its members believe truth can be attained by individuals using reason, consulting their tradition, and debating with their fellows. This would satisfy Fish’s requirements for a society capable of preserving free speech: reference to a “common good,” supported by a “faith,” and protected by an “originary exclusion” from its foes.</p>",

  "content": "<p>My first sight​ of E.M. Forster was of him coming towards me on Clare Bridge in Cambridge. It was a cold afternoon in November 1968 and Forster was on his way back to King’s College, next door to Clare, where I was in my first term as an undergraduate. He was wearing a thick coat, striped tie and flat cap, and walked with a stick. He slightly shied away against the parapet of the bridge when I went up to him, no doubt a reflection of the frequency with which he was accosted on his daily, stop-start walk. His look of quizzical apprehension changed to an amiable apology when I explained I was the Richard Shone to whom he had sent a note a few days earlier asking me to ‘drop in’. ‘Yes, of course you are,’ he said. The note had been prompted by Nancy Ackerley, a friend of mine and the sister of Forster’s great friend J.R. Ackerley, who had written introducing me and hoping we would meet. I had duly knocked on his door but there had been no reply. He examined the books I was carrying (a collection of Edwin Muir’s essays, of which he approved; Virginia Woolf’s Three Guineas, at which he wrinkled his nose) and asked me to come for a drink at six that evening, before moving off towards Clare Old Court with a curiously sideways walk that made him look as though he were being gently pulled away from his intended direction by a magnet.</p><p> At six I knocked on his door and heard his light-toned ‘Come in.’ At first I could see no one in the large, high-ceilinged room with its mass of Victorian furniture, books and pictures against Morris-style wallpaper, curtains drawn, softly lit by table lamps. Then I discovered Forster in a cushiony chair by the fireplace, glass of red Cinzano in hand. He offered me one and we settled down. It wasn’t immediately easy but after some pleasantries (and after establishing that he didn’t really approve of studying English literature, as I was doing), we got on to discussing Ackerley’s posthumous, recently published memoir, My Father and Myself, which disclosed his father’s two families (unknown to each other until Roger Ackerley’s death) and Ackerley’s own sexual problems. I had read it, with great enjoyment, in a proof copy that Nancy had lent me. (Soon afterwards she gave me a bound copy inscribed: ‘Dearest Richard, I know you like this book, and you know I don’t! but here it is with my love, Nance.’) Forster had not liked it, seemingly on personal rather than literary grounds. Its self-portrait was too bleak and one-sided: Ackerley was greatly loved by his friends and this was hardly evident. Forster had written to this effect to Duncan Grant, saying that he agreed with Grant and wished he could give Joe ‘a good smack!’ But Grant hadn’t read the book yet and the letter – one of the last Forster wrote in his own hand – had been addressed to Nancy’s flat in Putney. (All this led to a three-way correspondence summed up by Nancy as a typical ‘Morgan muddle’.)</p><p> There were one or two silences, but not embarrassing ones – at least not for me. I told him about the months I had spent working at Chatto & Windus before I came up to Cambridge, and that I had seen Leonard Woolf there from time to time on Hogarth Press business. Forster venerated Woolf (‘What a life he has led,’ he once wrote. ‘And how well he has led it’). Woolf had been a great help when he had stalled in writing A Passage to India and wanted encouragement. He told me Woolf had taught him to ride on Putney Common in preparation for his first visit to India in 1912. In Hyderabad he had ‘shot through the jungle – I like the altitude.’ ‘In Hyderabad?’ I asked. ‘No, on a horse!’ And there came, from under his wispy moustache, his characteristic sneezing laugh (eyes closed) followed by an appreciative little wail.</p><p> Before I left, I asked Forster about the somewhat incongruous presence, among the family portraits and Victorian views, of a reproduction of Picasso’s Boy Leading a Horse (1906) on the far wall. He told me he’d borrowed it years before from the college picture library, which loaned students and fellows original works and reproductions, and had been allowed to hold on to it. ‘It’s all down to Duncan really, as the library was his idea, set up by Maynard Keynes.’ A pause: ‘I don’t think I’ll return it.’</p><p> I saw Forster on several occasions over the following year. He told me that The Longest Journey was the novel he was most glad to have written (it was my least favourite); that he thought that Three Guineas was a mistake (as did most of Woolf’s friends); that he felt the Rubens recently installed in King’s chapel was a ‘folie de grandeur’ – the college had, he thought, been hoodwinked by Michael Jaffé, the Rubens expert – and did not suit the chapel’s interior (‘too coloured’). He said that Roger Fry had taught him all he knew about pictures – save ‘my own feelings about them’.</p><p> Another meeting came about through the young painter Mark Lancaster. He was the first artist-in-residence at King’s, and lived and worked in the Gibbs Building. His huge studio overlooked the quadrangle and from there we sometimes saw Forster (‘Morgan’ to us) making his slow sideways progress across the lawn. Mark was a glamorous and sociable figure. For me and one or two other undergraduates, part of that glamour derived from his having worked at Warhol’s Factory in New York, tangible evidence of which was a silkscreen head of Elizabeth Taylor on his wall. He was devoted to Forster and would often retell ‘Morgan’s latest’ bon mot or lightly scathing comment on one of the fellows, on whom he turned a rather sharp eye (including Michael Jaffé: ‘I can’t think Rubens would have cared for him’).</p><p> One Sunday morning Mark gave an impromptu party for Duncan Grant, who had come to Cambridge to look at the murals he had painted in what had once been Keynes’s rooms. (They are still on the wall: naked men and women dancing and picking grapes.) It was nearly fifty years since Grant had last seen them: in 1920 they had been overlaid with panels by himself and Vanessa Bell. He was moved to see the original decorations of 1910-11 and remembered his despair at failing to finish them, throwing down his brush and bursting into tears, as he told us later. Forster delighted in this recollection: ‘Yes, with me it was my pen!’</p><p> Mark had asked a dozen or more people to the party, all of them assembled by the time Forster arrived. Almost at once he saw his old friend standing in the middle of the room. ‘Duncan?’ he called out in an unusually deep voice, containing a note of interrogation. ‘Morgan?’ Grant replied in an even deeper voice. They had known each other for nearly sixty years but now met infrequently. Forster said that the room we were in had been Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson’s and that he hadn’t been in it since his death in 1932. Grant wondered why: ‘The fellow who occupied the rooms afterwards was a terrible bore.’ Hearing them talk together was like listening to a family conversation, but one wrapped in the accents and assumptions of the past.</p><p> On another of Grant’s visits to Cambridge, in early November 1969, a group of us went in search of Forster and found him in the Senior Combination Room, asleep in an armchair after lunch. We tiptoed away, but Grant remained and made a little drawing of him in a sketchbook. On another occasion, in March 1970, a few of us, including his friend Christopher Isherwood, went to his rooms. I remember the affectionate banter between Forster and Isherwood, and their contrasting hairstyles – Forster’s a rather unruly, fine white mop, Isherwood’s a razor-sharp crew cut, on which Forster commented, asking Isherwood to turn round so he could see the full effect.</p><p> This was their last meeting. By then, after a series of small strokes, Forster was fading. One evening when I was going to have a drink with Nick Furbank (Forster’s friend and future biographer), I found his room empty but heard him call from Forster’s rooms above. He had found Forster on the floor of his bedroom. I helped Nick steer him to his armchair. He was smiling and alert and seemed concerned only that he had interrupted our evening. He amused us when, on Nick’s asking what he had done with his recently awarded Order of Merit, he said it was safely in his sock drawer. He added that lying on the floor had some advantages: he liked the different viewpoint.</p><p> After a final stroke in King’s at the end of May 1970, Forster died on 7 June. Nick wrote to me about his final days and funeral:</p><p> He was worried and miserable during those last days in King’s, after his stroke, but not from fear of death, which he often said didn’t frighten him at all: I’m sure quite truly. One feels ill in going through the things in his room. It’s not as sad as I thought it might have been, as it seems that all through his last years he was tranquilly putting his belongings in order – not apple-pie order, being Morgan. It’s rather that he gave them a last look, tidied a drawer here, left a label or message to a friend there, as a pleasant, cheerful human activity. </p><p> The funeral was odd. He had forbidden any religious ceremony, so we sat for ten minutes or so in the crematorium chapel listening to Beethoven’s Pastoral Symphony, the Sixth [a mistake for the scherzo of the Fifth Symphony], while the undertaker’s man twiddled the knobs of the hi-fi in black gloves. It was all rather uncomfortable; however, as we were all lining up, after inspecting the flowers in the cloister, to return to our Rolls-Royces, we suddenly saw that all the undertaker’s men had their heads in the bonnet of the leading Rolls. It was stuck immovably. The chief undertaker came up the path, smacking his forehead with his black gloves most theatrically, saying ‘Never in the twenty years …’ etc. It cheered us up no end: undoubtedly Morgan’s spirit at work. </p><p>As a memento, Nick gave me Forster’s narrow christening brush of 1879 with an elaborate silver ‘M’ on the top. And I was to pass on to Grant two lovely, spotted seashells which, as he remarked on receiving them, were very like the one in Rembrandt’s famous drawing. I still have the brush, and like to imagine the formidably doting Lily Forster using it to smooth baby Morgan’s curls 140 years ago.</p><p>\n                The Editor \n                London Review of Books, \n                28 Little Russell Street \n                London, WC1A 2HNletters@lrb.co.uk\n                Please include name, address, and a telephone number.\n            </p><p>\n            The Editor\n            London Review of Books\n            28 Little Russell Street\n            London, WC1A 2HN\n            letters@lrb.co.uk\n            Please include name, address and a telephone number\n        </p><p>\n                            Read anywhere with the London Review of Books app, available now from the App Store for Apple devices, Google Play for Android devices and Amazon for your Kindle Fire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor highlights from the latest issue, our archive and the blog, as well as news, events and exclusive promotions.\n                        </p>",

  "content": "<p>On July 7th, Harper’s Magazine published what it called “A Letter on Justice and Open Debate,” which quickly became part of the conversation around the subject of “cancel culture.” The letter, which has been signed by more than a hundred intellectuals, academics, and authors, noted that “the forces of illiberalism are gaining strength throughout the world and have a powerful ally in Donald Trump,” and argued against an “intolerant climate that has set in on all sides.” The letter continued, “While we have come to expect this on the radical right, censoriousness is also spreading more widely in our culture: an intolerance of opposing views, a vogue for public shaming and ostracism, and the tendency to dissolve complex policy issues in a blinding moral certainty.” It went on to say, “The restriction of debate, whether by a repressive government or an intolerant society, invariably hurts those who lack power and makes everyone less capable of democratic participation. The way to defeat bad ideas is by exposure, argument, and persuasion, not by trying to silence or wish them away.”</p><p>The letter was signed by the novelists Martin Amis, J. K. Rowling, and Salman Rushdie, leftists such as Noam Chomsky and Gloria Steinem, and journalists, including several New Yorker contributors. Among the signatories was Thomas Chatterton Williams, a contributing writer at the New York Times Magazine and a columnist for Harper’s, who also had a hand in writing the letter. Williams is the author of two memoirs, “Losing My Cool” and “Self-Portrait in Black and White,” which recount his struggles with racial identity as a teen-ager and as an adult. The son of a Black father and a white mother, he describes himself in his second book as “an ex-black man.” He is known for his critique of Ta-Nehisi Coates, whom Williams believes overemphasizes race and racism, creating “a fantasy that flattens psychological and material difference within and between groups.”</p><p>I recently spoke by phone with Williams, who was at his office in France, where he lives. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed what the Harper’s letter aimed to accomplish, whether cancel culture has always existed in various forms, and his concerns about Black Lives Matter and the media’s focus on COVID-19 mortality rates among people of color.</p><p>It’s no secret. No one is trying to be evasive, but it came out of conversations that the five of us—[the Atlantic staff writer and former New Yorker staff writer] George Packer, myself, [the Columbia professor of humanities] Mark Lilla, [the journalist] Robert F. Worth, and [the historian and professor of journalism] David Greenberg—started on an e-mail chain five or six weeks ago, talking about something that I’ve been talking about with some of them for years. A mood or climate seems to have set in, especially in the past almost four years, with the intensity that Trump brings to every topic, and social media—the growth of the importance of social media can’t be taken away from anything we’re talking about. I remember I was on Facebook and other things more, but Twitter has become all-consuming, especially if you work in the media or in academia, and so it feels like Twitter has taken on this invisible, impersonal force that works through people but no one in particular, that sweeps through and enacts public humiliation and punishment, and has become another figure in all of our lives, like the spectre of Trump hanging over us.</p><p>At some point, we decided to see if we could draft an open letter. We really didn’t even know if anybody would pay attention. The five of us started talking about who we might be able to reach out to and see if they might sign it. We went through multiple drafts on our own, and then about a month ago, we started sending it out to other people, and we got yeses and nos, and some of the people that said yes and some of the people that said no had really smart responses, with incredible feedback. We then came back and incorporated it, so like twenty people contributed writing to it.</p><p>No, I wouldn’t say that, even. I contributed in an early draft. I was very involved, and then it was a real collective. This is a document that doesn’t have an author, but it has the hands of over twenty people, and especially the hands of five people.</p><p>You need to understand that this is something that we didn’t realize we would get anybody interested in. Some of the people that we knew the best said that they were uncomfortable or afraid of the backlash or couldn’t get involved, and some of the people we didn’t know very well stepped in, so we didn’t have a way of gauging. Everybody knew some names and began contacting them on their own, with their own language. Sometimes I was texting people three lines. Sometimes David was writing beautiful long letters full of tons of evidence of why the people might want to sign. Nobody that any of us contacted was, like, “Let me see who else is signing, and then I’ll get back to you.” Not a single person. I don’t think any of us have ever done this before, so it didn’t even occur to us that that could be a critique down the road.</p><p>How important was racial or gender or ideological diversity, especially getting people on the left? I know you have previously said that the letter started out more focussed on the sins of the left.</p><p>There was always disagreement. There was never one way that the letter was conceived. There was always some feeling that Trump should be more important and some feeling that in a short letter you have to focus on the kind of culture that’s coming in our own industry, which Trump doesn’t actually fully control. Then there was a feeling, after talking to more and more people that we respected, that we really do have to acknowledge the fact that nothing exists in a vacuum outside of Trump.</p><p>You said, “The critique is against censoriousness and so after realizing that the letter would be incomplete by solely focusing on the left, we felt it was necessary to be absolutely clear that Trump is the canceller-in-chief.”</p><p>Right, exactly. We all talked for quite a while about how we can’t really think of someone who has been more cancelled in American culture recently than Colin Kaepernick. We were talking about the Black reporter in Pittsburgh who was unable to cover the protests because of a tweet. We are against Twitter being involved in your office decisions and your H.R. department. Do you see what I’m saying? It was interpreted in a different way. It was a constant conversation of “Let’s always be thinking of ways that we can make this as ideologically diverse as possible,” and, also, we know from our own lives that you can’t predict how people think based on their color category, religion, or gender identity, or any of that.</p><p>You mentioned ideological diversity and the importance of it. As far I could tell, there were no open Trump supporters who signed the letter. Did you feel that it was important to not have signers beyond a certain level of conservatism in part because then critics could say you don’t really care about liberalism? Trump has the support of more than forty per cent of the country, so aren’t we all drawing our own lines somewhere about ideological diversity?</p><p>There was a lot of discussion of that. It was not something that we didn’t know would be a point of contention, but we also basically made the decision that we have to be as idealistic as possible within the bounds of understanding that we have to be pragmatic too, and rhetorically effective. You simply cannot have a document that was as successful as ours, I believe, at this moment, with throwing every single viewpoint in. Even one person who I reached out to, who isn’t, I don’t think, a Trump supporter, said, “No, I won’t sign this because I don’t believe that Trump is the greatest threat in the nation.” We were kind of skeptical that you could have a defense of liberal values, a serious defense of liberal values, with someone who was really a diehard Trump supporter, too. We also felt that if you got somebody who was, you might very well lose some other people that you need to make this a rhetorically effective document.</p><p>Bari Weiss, who just resigned from the New York Times, and who signed the Harper’s letter, mentioned in her resignation letter that she had been brought in after Trump’s election to bring more ideological diversity. But the Times didn’t hire a pro-Trump columnist, which I don’t have a problem with if I’m honest with myself.</p><p>I suppose I’m wondering whether we’re all drawing the line somewhere, and therefore if in fact both you and people to your left who you view as restrictive are drawing lines on a spectrum, rather than there being some giant chasm about what the meaning of liberalism is.</p><p>I think it’s right and not right. I think it’s absolutely undeniable that nobody really advocates for complete total speech without any consequence or absolute freedom of expression. There’s a line that most of us agree on somewhere. We wouldn’t want calls for pedophilia. But that’s not actually what we’re talking about. We’re not saying that there are no standards or no lines. This letter is about the climate of censoriousness and self-censorship and fear that happens when people are made an example of on social media with no recourse and there are calls for their stigmatization. That’s the part of it that goes beyond just speech or disagreement within the bounds of civility. It’s this extra step that seeks to punish and also banish from the community a respectable opinion. What happens is that your employer is contacted and you must be fired from your job, but then you’re supposed to not be employable anywhere. The really seriously troubling case that I can think of that happened recently is David Shor. That’s a quintessential example of what we’re talking about.</p><p>Right, so David Shor was a researcher who tweeted a research paper done by Omar Wasow, whom I have interviewed, and who is a very smart guy who studies how protests affect elections. People on Twitter criticized Shor, and then his employer, Civis Analytics, panicked and fired him. I think most people who have been following these issues view that case as pretty disgraceful. Are there other cases where you think that people have been fired and have been told they should never be hired again for sins that minor?</p><p>This is not my personal example, but I think there was a great amount of debate over [the resignation of former New York Times opinion editor] James Bennet. I wasn’t organizing a letter around something like that, because I think that gets in the way of making a larger point.</p><p>There have been many, many academics who have been silenced. There was a U.C.L.A. professor who got in serious trouble for just reading “Letter from Birmingham Jail.” [William Peris, a lecturer in political science, reportedly came into conflict with students over his decision to read aloud the N-word in King’s letter and show a documentary about lynching. U.C.L.A. told The New Yorker that there was no formal investigation, but that the situation was being “reviewed.”] There is an academic at the University of Chicago who questioned some aspects of the orthodoxy on Black Lives Matter. [Harald Uhlig, a professor of economics, compared Black Lives Matter activists to “flat-earthers and creationists.” A student then claimed that Uhlig had made racially discriminatory remarks in his classroom. The university conducted an investigation and found that there was no basis for further proceedings.]</p><p>A lot of people say there’s no such thing as cancel culture and then you name an example and they’re, like, “That person deserved it,” so then there is cancel culture, but it works in its accountability. But you don’t actually need that many people, because all you need is a few high-profile cases that make examples and the rest of us see and we change our behavior accordingly. We also don’t just change the behavior that might be argued against as being wrong. We steer far clear of the boundary, and so it has a narrowing and I think really stifling effect on not just speech but on thought, and that’s really terrifying.</p><p>I’m sure some of your readers on Twitter can already imagine, like, laughing that it’s anecdotal, but I have tons of people who tell me they wouldn’t write certain things, that they wouldn’t say certain things, that they’re not comfortable even entering into a conversation on Black Lives Matter, on Israel, or any of these things, because they didn’t feel that they could even get into a conversation without enormous repercussions that would be detrimental, because they don’t possess the identity that gives them what I would say is the epistemological authority to even weigh in, and so it’s just a land mine. You must possess a particular identity to be able to participate in certain conversations or you face a backlash that comes at you so fast that you can’t even defend yourself against it. It penetrates your workplace.</p><p>I think that we agree that there are certain areas, involving racial and gender identity, for example, that are becoming more contested to talk about. I also think there have always been things that people were scared to talk about, whether it was religion, or Israel, or the military, or police officers. The letter says that things are becoming more constricted. Are things over all becoming more constricted, or are new groups making their voices heard in ways that are perceived as constricting sometimes, but in ways that different groups in America and throughout the world have always done? I don’t want to defend that as always being good, but why are we certain it’s new?</p><p>People are, like, well, nothing is new. Jesus Christ was cancelled. Of course, people objecting to certain people’s behavior or speech has been with us forever—certain views being silenced and others being prioritized. There was a counter-letter that was, like, Black people have always been cancelled and shut out, or have been on the edge of being cancelled. I’m the son of a Black man who was born in the segregated South. I’m very familiar with the kind of cancel culture that he had to pass through and the ways in which he experienced exactly what they’re talking about. But what bothers me and worries me is that the world that we’re creating and that’s enabled by the Twitter reality that takes hold is one in which we’re not actually trying to make everybody as secure as the straight white man who used to be super-secure. We’re actually trying to make everybody as insecure as my father used to be, but everybody can catch it now. That’s why the letter calls for putting ideas out in the clarifying light of open debate where they can be either defended or defeated but in good faith, and not looking to appeal to the fury of the mob. I don’t want to live in a world where the white men I work with have to be reduced to being as insecure as my father used to be.</p><p>Do you think we’re really in danger of that? You said your dad grew up in the segregated South. I’m a white man who works for a liberal media institution. I feel like I’m very far from what you just described.</p><p>You are, but the world that I feel like is taking hold—and I don’t want to get into hyperbole. I think that I’m using that language that sounds hyperbolic only when repeated back, because that’s actually language that comes in the critique of our letter. They say Black people have always been cancelled. I wouldn’t start with that. I’m responding to that assertion. My dad comes from a culture of having felt that you could be cancelled. I don’t want to extend that insecurity as far as we can. I always write from the position that we are not in the same country that my father was and that none of this is the same as it used to be, and we should all step back from hyperbolic language that overestimates the challenges we face in light of the challenges that we’ve already overcome.</p><p>I agree that, generally speaking, we want a less censorious society rather than a more censorious society. I worked at a magazine, The New Republic, where in 2003 Tony Judt was stripped of his contributing-editor title, because, in a different publication, he wrote a piece saying a one-state solution for Israel might be a good idea. I don’t want to defend that, but was he cancelled from the magazine, which he never wrote for again? I do wonder whether these things have been going on for longer than we think, and I do sometimes feel that, when it comes from certain quarters now, it’s viewed as a bigger threat to liberal democracy than it used to be in the past. Do you think I’m off there?</p><p>I think there is something that has to be part of the definition of cancel culture now that is not contained in the description you used in the New Republic example but that can’t be extricated from the technology aspect. Yes, there are views that could get you in trouble or there are views that would affect your employment in the past, but cancel culture now relies on outrage, and then there has to be a whipped-up movement through—it often happens to be through social media—and then it has to be contacting your employer, and then it has to be not attaching to your idea or the work that you did but actually attaching to you as a stigmatized person. That’s what cancel culture actually does—you are outside of the circle of respectability. I don’t know enough about the case at The New Republic. I don’t believe that it operated that way.</p><p>Did you follow the case of Blake Neff, who worked for Tucker Carlson’s show and was fired for posting horribly racist things on a message board unrelated to his work?</p><p>A little bit, yeah. I think that once your employer—here’s the thing about cancel culture. It’s not about you violating your employer’s clear rules. I’m sure that what Blake did was against the rules of his employment. Cancel culture also operates on another level that makes it very difficult to defend against, which is that the rules are changing. Part of it is that you have broken some rule that is not specified yet or clearly in your employment contract or even necessarily in our public understanding of norms. You’ve tripped a new wire, and you’re being made an example of. Being fired for bad performance or for having an alter ego that posts incredibly racist stuff is not cancel culture.</p><p>Explain to me why, though. Forget whether it happened to be in his particular employment contract or not.</p><p>I think it matters quite a lot. If you’re tweeting research and you attach no commentary to it and then you’re fired because people attach a context to it that you didn’t anticipate and couldn’t be expected to anticipate, that is very different than if you are sneaking into an alter ego that is tweeting racist language that is against the rules of your employment.</p><p>We keep coming back to David Shor, which I agree is terrible. I think most people think it’s terrible—I obviously don’t want to defend it.</p><p>In the N.B.A., the rule is still that you have to stand for the national anthem. I assume you don’t think that if someone knelt for it that they should be fired.</p><p>I’m not aware of that being a part of your employment contract that you must. [The N.B.A. rulebook says that “players, coaches, and trainers must stand and line up in a dignified posture” during the anthem.]</p><p>I asked the question in a bad way. Even if someone didn’t violate their employment contract, if someone was going on a Web site and saying, as Blake Neff did, some awful racist stuff, which I don’t even feel comfortable reading, or got fired like Nick Cannon did, for anti-Semitism, by Viacom—is that cancel culture?</p><p>We have to have some agreed-upon standards. Part of what the problem is in this debate is deciding how we’re changing our standards right now. I understand this is not a science, but if there’s a punitive aspect to the collective response to something you do and it’s around a not-yet-solidified norm, that seems to me to be very different than to transgressing what seems to be a commonly understood norm. I know that you can say that there’s lots of difficulty in understanding, but you know that there actually is a difference.</p><p>Neff, it’s true, violated what I think a lot of us would agree as norms by saying a bunch of awful things. At the same time, he works for a television show that is able to broadcast these things every night, which the President watches and tweets about. Nick Cannon, who circulated anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, had prominent athletes speak up for him, before they recanted. I think some people would see these things as cancel culture. They would say people are overly sensitive.</p><p>You’re looking at something that is new, and, when there’s enough of a quantitative difference, you have a qualitative difference. This is something that has been with us—an impulse to punish and to single out and to scapegoat and to ostracize and stigmatize, that’s not new. But when you have a quantitative difference that technology affords—and I don’t mean to keep coming back to technology, but it’s inextricable from the experience now.</p><p>This letter was an attempt to open a conversation, to start thinking seriously about something that many people have noticed is going on. You don’t get an international conversation with a three-paragraph document like this if it doesn’t touch on something that many people understand is going on. This letter has been reprinted in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Japan. I’m getting interview requests from Chile. It was printed in Mexico. There were three articles at least in the Guardian about it in the U.K. This is something.</p><p>I’ve seen you talk about the fact that, as you once put it in an interview, no one owns any topics. Essentially, we should look at the content of what people say, not their identity. Is that accurate?</p><p>I understand how experience informs insight, but I don’t think there are topics where some identities must simply be silent. What I reject is what the economist Glenn Loury calls identity epistemology, which is that I as someone partially descended from slaves have access to an understanding of American reality that can never be open to you. I reject that idea. I think that if you actually care enough to figure it out, you can understand much of my experience to the extent that anyone can understand an individual. You can, if you want to. Now, a lot of people don’t actually try hard enough.</p><p>What about people having the right to say certain things based on their identity? I was wondering if you thought that people could be privileged to say certain things or speak on certain topics, or that the most important thing was to judge the words themselves.</p><p>I studied philosophy. I genuinely believe that the most important thing is to judge the quality of the insights, the idea, the language, the argument. I don’t think that there is a Black point of view, because Black people don’t all agree on anything. When you say that somebody has more authority to speak as a Black person, what does that mean?</p><p>In “Losing My Cool,” you wrote, “Where I lived, books were like kryptonite to” the N-word [the text uses “niggas”]—“they were terrified, allergic, broke out in rashes and hives.”</p><p>That’s not something a white person can really say in most polite societies. It’s also an idea that I think a lot of people would find very problematic—that books were like kryptonite to Black people.</p><p>That’s why the context is important. The whole book was about how books were my father’s life and that the Black culture that he comes from was one that prioritized education as the most important thing that a human being could participate in, the act of cultivating yourself. That comes in the context of me saying that the kind of street culture that I was in was making a false claim that books were kryptonite, that they were not for us. We were fooling ourselves in that we were participating in a culture that was monetizing the glorification of our anti-intellectualism, which is my argument against hip-hop culture. When it’s sliced into this little bit on Twitter, it’s to make me look like some type of racist who hates his Blackness. When, in fact, the book is a love letter to the kind of Black culture and tradition that my father comes from.</p><p>Just to give the context, you finish off that paragraph by saying, “Charles Dickens was something that swung between your legs, not the author of Martin Chuzzlewit. You could get your ass kicked for name-dropping and using big words. Brothers weren’t out to be poets or theoreticians; most of the time, they weren’t even trying to be articulate—they talked with their hands (fists, daps, slaps, pounds, peace signs, jump shots, tabletop percussion) and yearned to be athletes and rappers, not scholars or gentlemen.” The point I was trying to make was that this is something that you can say and get published in a book because of your identity and other people can’t.</p><p>Other people can’t, but is that the best way that we can have conversations around knowledge and human experience, that other people can’t? That I’m not sure about. Because I can imagine a situation where you could understand my experience enough where you could actually suggest some insight into the dynamics that play around toxic masculinity or street authenticity that gets conflated with racial authenticity.</p><p>The fact that you’re not allowed to publish that is not my choosing. I think that there’s a way that you could engage in that that would be good-faith and would be equally insightful even if you’re coming from outside the identity. It’s not the blood or the skin that gives you the ability to understand the spirit.</p><p>But it also seems to me an idea that has a racially charged history to it, and that we should want to be careful when people say things like that. Maybe that’s where we disagree.</p><p>Here’s where I draw a line, and this is why it takes people to actually listen to arguments and not scan quotes for gotcha clickbait. I’m not saying you. I’m saying that people love the gotcha as a very good way to get likes and a good way to get the dopamine hits. I engage in it just like a lot of us, because we’re all incentivized to behave this way, and it’s worth something to resist. But, if you engage in a good-faith way, then I think you can actually have conversations about difficult subjects. What I’m saying is that we’re not reading each other in the way that’s conducive to everybody having the ability to encounter the other’s experience. We’re engaging each other in ways that contribute to the fortification of identity epistemology, and I think the thing that’s so sad about that is it limits the amount of conversation we could have. That is impoverishing if what you actually care about is knowledge and ideas and making a kind of multi-ethnic society work.</p><p>I guess my point would be that if a white person said that line, I’m not sure the appropriate response would be to sit and thoughtfully listen to them.</p><p>I was kidding. I wanted to ask about what you wrote about Black Lives Matter in your second book. You said that such groups “reinforce the same racist habits of thoughts they claim to wish to defeat. I do not mean this point rhetorically—I mean it literally.” You went on to say that, although you “overwhelmingly share” Black Lives Matter’s aims, “its very framing—the notion that some lives are essentially black while others are white—is both politically true in a specific sense and, in a broader way, philosophically inadequate.” And “We will never be able to outwit such complicated and tenacious pathologies with the stale and deficient mental habits that produced them in the first place. If, as the cliché has it, one definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results, how could we?” Do you feel that’s held true in the past few months?</p><p>Black Lives Matter in the past few months has been effective in mobilizing quite a lot of empathy, and who knows what the polls will show next year, but right now it seems like, overwhelmingly, the public supports the objectives of the movement and it recognizes that racism is a problem in American life. I believe the part you’re reading from refers to my larger argument that I don’t think we’re going to solve the problem of racism if we don’t keep our eye on actually abolishing and getting rid of the categories that come out of the collision of Africa and Europe in the slave trade and the New World. If we don’t get rid of these categories, which most of us would say we don’t believe have a biological basis, then actually they imply certain racist ideas that can’t be overcome.</p><p>So Black Lives Matter is effective now, and I’m rooting for it, but my position is that there are not fundamentally, inherently, essentially, Black or white lives. There is human life, and we have different ethnicities and cultural traditions, but we have to abolish the idea of race, full stop, or we’re always going to have the residue of racism.</p><p>So you still believe that Black Lives Matter reinforces the same habits of thought that they claim they wish to defeat?</p><p>I think that there’s a limit to what can happen so long as we believe that there are Black lives and white lives. I think it’s effective in what it’s trying to achieve now. But my argument in the book is about how does a society ever unlearn race, and you can’t unlearn race by holding onto the categories that racism creates. We don’t live in a society anywhere near getting rid of those categories. Black Lives Matter doesn’t get us closer to getting rid of those categories. What it does raise fundamental awareness of is how Black people and other people suffer disproportionate violence and mistreatment, and I think that is really positive. But I don’t see how the framing gets us closer to a society where white people give up their whiteness and Black people are free to finally move beyond the stigmatization.</p><p>How would one frame the fact that tens of thousands more African-Americans have died from the coronavirus than we would expect from their percentage of the population, without resorting to the categories that you’re critical of?</p><p>Oh, I think that we would have a serious conversation about what happens with class in this country. Oftentimes, we conflate race and class, and in many ways they’re sticky and they’re difficult to disentangle, but I think that many people point out that you can’t solve the racial problem in a meaningful way if you don’t address the class problem, and, maybe more important than that, just diversifying the top one per cent won’t help those people either.</p><p>O.K., but we know that the people who have been disproportionally hurt by the coronavirus are not just people without means, but also specifically Black and Latino people who face issues with getting proper medical care even compared with whites of similar circumstances.</p><p>Yeah, also, they are disproportionally essential workers, and many fewer Black and Latino people worked in positions that they could do remotely.</p><p>I agree with you—class is a huge issue. But I’m just not quite sure how we have that conversation without saying that doctors treat Black and white patients even of the same socioeconomic class differently. I don’t know how we don’t talk about all those things.</p><p>We can talk about lots of things that have been talked about. The kinds of cultural experiences and racial experiences that lead some Black people like my father to be more mistrustful of seeking medical care. We can talk about lots of aspects that contribute to the fact that Black people have found themselves in lines of work that expose them to COVID-19 more—the fact that even experiencing racism can take physical tolls that then make you have co-morbidities and lots of things.</p><p>I’m not saying that we’re not living in a very racist country, but I am saying that I start to get uncomfortable when it’s called “the Black Plague” as though the disease affects Black people differently biologically, as though there is a biological weakness in blackness, as though we can meaningfully talk about contagion by racializing it in our own contemporary terms with understanding our own social divisions. That’s where I get worried. And also there’s a long history of equating disease with inferior groups, and so I think we have to be very, very, very careful when we casually call things Black. “The Black Plague” was a title of a piece in The New Yorker that I think was actually a little bit dangerous. I think it’s even dangerous from a pragmatic level. The only country in the world that is experiencing the kind of surges of COVID-19 right now and not complying with official guidance is the United States of America. It’s a complete outlier, and why is it? It’s because the disease is racialized in America, uniquely. There is no European country, no matter how multi-ethnic, including France, which is a very multi-ethnic society and doesn’t collect data based on race.</p><p>And, when you call it the Black Plague, you end up with a bunch of white people saying that the disease doesn’t affect them and behaving in all types of ways that actually end up spreading it.</p><p>So pieces like the New Yorker piece are one of the reasons that it’s out of control in America and it’s killing tens of thousands more Black people? Is that what you mean?</p><p>No, that’s not what I’m saying, and please don’t put that kind of wording on it. I’m not saying that pieces like the New Yorker piece are why. I’m saying that America has a problem, as reflected in the language of the New Yorker piece. It wasn’t the New Yorker alone. There were many publications that racialized COVID-19 as a Black disease.</p><p>Then you have a situation where everybody isn’t responding to the disease as though it affects everybody. Even though in the outer banlieues, in the less affluent suburbs of Paris where the population is heavily Black and Arab, you do have disproportionate cases but the disease was never racialized.</p><p>I can only speak for myself as someone who did interviews on this. My thinking was that the coronavirus was affecting Black and Latino people much more than white people, per capita, and I thought that was something to highlight. I don’t think that’s the reason that many white people didn’t take the disease perhaps as seriously as they should have.</p><p>Once the disease became widely racialized in the public conversation, there was a lack of vigilance that set in in certain white communities, especially in the red states. That’s pretty well established. There was a Washington Post article that said that once the disease was considered to be something that affected Blacks disproportionately and didn’t really claim young, healthy whites, then they kind of tuned out. [The article, which was published on May 17th, interviewed people in an upscale suburb of Atlanta, who were largely unconcerned about the virus. It was not about race, though one man noted, “When you start seeing where the cases are coming from and the demographics—I’m not worried.”]</p><p>I really don’t want you to say that I am saying that the media is responsible for that. I’m not saying that. I’m saying that the language of racialization and the idea that it became a Black disease did lead to white people tuning out.</p><p>There was a brief controversy where you tweeted “you look interesting” at a nonbinary person, which got a lot of anger on Twitter. Do you want to explain what you meant?</p><p>Sure, I just want to say that I actually was walking into an interview at France Culture at the time I saw the tweet. I didn’t click on the writer’s bio, and I just tossed off a “you look interesting.” I didn’t know that the person was nonbinary. I regret the whole thing, but you can’t actually answer these things when you get a pile-on like that, because you won’t be taken in good faith. There’s an idea that I meant something much more than what I meant in that. My response is to disengage, because I thought I was dealing with somebody as an individual. I didn’t even know how they’re identified. I want to stress that the person’s name is Matt, and I didn’t click on their bio. And then it came to my attention, but you can’t argue your way out of that on Twitter.</p><p>[After our conversation, Williams wrote on Twitter that he had deleted the tweet, which “in retrospect was mean spirited. I’m mad at myself for commenting on someone’s looks instead of their ideas, especially so because I didn’t realize their identity, which obviously could make my comment more hurtful.”]</p><p>I know there was a funny thing that went around Twitter about you kicking someone out of your house, or someone “self-ejecting” from your house, for saying something not nice about Bari Weiss. Do you want to just, for the record, tell people what happened?</p><p>That got more attention than I can believe. Can I just say something that might not completely satisfy you? I really can’t comment on that for the sanctity of my own household sanity.</p>",

  "content": "<p>The “Theophrastan character” is not often mentioned today, perhaps because it is so little known as a genre. Yet for centuries this was what “character” meant in literature. A list of familiar social types compiled in the fourth century B.C. that chronicled human traits and foibles—from bore to boaster, cynic to coward—influenced the development of later fiction and drama, and remains sharply pertinent in psychology, journalism, cartoon art, and popular culture.</p><p>Theophrastan character sketches deliberately describe a recognizable model of behavior rather than a mocked or skewered individual. Dickens’s ever-hopeful Mr. Micawber, clinging to the thought that “something will turn up,” is a descendant of the Theophrastan character, as are Molière’s miser and hypochondriac. Psychologists and psychoanalysts have created character types on what could be called the Theophrastan model, like the obsessive-compulsive, the hysteric, the impulsive man, and the paranoid (whom Theophrastus, lacking the resources of the DSM, might have called “The Suspicious Man”). The “white working-class voter” is a Theophrastan type, as is the equally hypothetical “soccer mom,” not to mention generational “types” like the baby boomer and the millennial. By the twenty-first century, the “character sketch” (or “character portrait”) had become the frequent province of editorial journalism, both print and electronic, as well as of social media and stand-up comedy. “Any kid with a passionate interest in science was a wonk, a square, a dweeb, a doofus, or a geek,” wrote the scientist Stephen Jay Gould, a self-confessed geek. (Within a year or two, however, this “depreciative” term—“an overly diligent, unsociable student,” according to the Oxford English Dictionary—would morph into the glamorous style called “geek chic.”)</p><p>Why has this ancient mode survived so long? “The Characters suggested an adaptable form and a set of basic techniques, according to which human types of any century or country could be depicted,” observes J. W. Smeed. “The book seemed to offer an invitation to later writers to borrow the method and use it to describe their own contemporaries.” He adds, “I cannot think of a smaller book with a greater influence.” </p><p>A consideration of that influence, beyond the “character collections” of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which were enormously popular in their own time but much less so today, will speak directly to the fascination with character that still dominates intellectual and public life.</p><p>Theophrastus (ca. 370–285 B.C.), born Tyrtamus, was a student and colleague of Aristotle, chosen by him as his successor to direct the Peripatetic school in Athens. His name, which translates to “the divine speaker,” is an honorific said to have been given him by Aristotle in acknowledgment of his eloquence.</p><p>Called by some “the father of botany,” a topic on which he wrote two large and important early treatises, Theophrastus produced a wide range of scholarly work, very little of which has survived, in areas as diverse as physics, biology, law, ethics, rhetoric, mathematics, music, and poetics. He is best known today for the thirty fictional sketches that are known collectively as the Characters, each of which illustrates a dominant attribute, or fault, or “vice.”</p><p>As Jeffrey Rusten points out in his edition and translation of the Characters, “If it were not firmly established, Theophrastus’ title might better be rendered ‘traits,’ ” since it is part of his conception that “individual good or bad traits of character may be isolated and studied separately”—a point also made by Aristotle in the Nicomachean Ethics. Aristotle himself had produced in that work a striking description of magnificence, or “the magnificent man,” situated at the mean between stinginess and vulgarity, but the virtuous mean is not the substance with which Theophrastus will work in the Characters. His thirty memorable “characters” are all extremes, whether deficient or excessive.</p><p>Whether his goal in writing them was ethical, rhetorical, satiric, comic, or to enliven his classroom lectures—scholars have suggested all of these, sometimes in combination—the result was remarkable: his imitators and stylistic heirs included some of the most notable writers of the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, as well as a surprising number and variety of modern practitioners. The psychologist Gordon Allport quoted the whole of “The Penurious Man” in his Pattern and Growth in Personality, observing, “Though written over two thousand years ago it is applicable to some of our acquaintances today.”</p><p>Theophrastus’s most immediate literary influence, however, was on the comic playwright Menander, who may have been one of his students. “You will find,” the British scholar G. S. Gordon told an Oxford audience,</p><p>that whenever Characters are written there is this same conjunction, of Character-Writing and Comedy; to every Theophrastus, his Menander. To Hall, Overbury, and Earle, the accepted imitators of Theophrastus in England, corresponds Ben Jonson with his Comedy of Humours, an earlier, harsher, and profounder version of the later Comedy of Manners. To La Bruyère, his professed disciple in France, corresponds the comedy of Molière, the French Menander. To the Tatler and the Spectator, the New Testament, as I may call them, of Character-writing in England, corresponds the comedy of Congreve, our English Molière.</p><p>Gordon added that such a conjunction always implies or reflects some philosophy of conduct. “Virtue once admitted to be the mean,” as Aristotle had established, “it became necessary to define all the extremes, the too little and too much of the social appearances of man.” This “too little and too much” would furnish the basic materials of comic types, from the miser to the libertine, the fashionable peacock, and the glutton.</p><p>Comedy, as is often observed, is an essentially conservative genre, as is satire. Both point toward the foibles and follies—and sometimes the delusions and sheer wickedness—of human beings. Here ethical “character” and two different but related modes of literary “character,” the Theophrastan prose sketch and the theatrical role, come together.</p><p>Since they would exercise so great an influence upon his imitators and (witting or unwitting) literary heirs, it may be useful here to list the thirty “characters” as we have them from Theophrastus. Richard Aldington’s titles for them, derived from scholarly work of the early twentieth century and generally adopted by commentators, describe the person (“The Flatterer,” “The Arrogant Man,” etc.), whereas Benjamin Boyce, and Jeffrey Rusten in his recent Loeb translation, names the characteristic, or foible (“Flattery,” “Arrogance”). In Aldington’s version, the original Theophrastan characters are:</p><p>The DissimulatorThe FlattererThe Chatterer (or “The Bore”)The RusticThe Complaisant ManThe Reckless CynicThe Loquacious ManThe NewsmongerThe Unscrupulous ManThe Penurious ManThe Gross ManThe Unseasonable ManThe Officious ManThe Stupid ManThe Surly ManThe Superstitious ManThe GrumblerThe Distrustful ManThe Offensive ManThe Unpleasant ManThe Vain ManThe Mean ManThe BoasterThe Arrogant ManThe CowardThe OligarchThe Late-LearnerThe SlandererThe Friend of the RabbleThe Avaricious Man</p><p>From this list, even without looking at the individual descriptions, it is easy to understand Allport’s sense that these two-thousand-year-old types are readily recognizable in the modern world.</p><p>“Theophrastus’ characters remain fixed,” notes the philosopher Amélie Rorty. “They are not transformed by the unfolding of events. On the contrary, their dispositional characteristics allow them to be used to develop a narrative or to stabilize the structure of a society.” In other words, as events unfold, the “character” becomes even more like himself or herself—sometimes to the point of comedy or parody. “At a time when bad behavior flourishes, even among our leaders,” says the novelist and critic Francine Prose, Theophrastus’s “portraits of boors, braggarts, and blowhards have never felt more current.” The classicist Mary Beard agrees: “These Characters are people we know—they’re our quirky neighbors, our creepy bosses, our blind dates from hell.”</p><p>The format of the Characters is fairly uniform. Each begins with a definition of a quality (“Chattering is the mania of talking hugely without thinking”; “Grumbling is complaining too much of one’s lot”; “Penuriousness is economy carried beyond all measure”), although not all scholars agree that Theophrastus himself wrote these opening sentences. Then the chosen trait is illustrated by a series of descriptions of actions or words. The Chatterer (in some translations, “The Bore”) “sits down beside someone he never saw before and begins by praising his wife; then describes a dream he had the night before; then passes to his dinner and relates it in detail.” When the Grumbler is told of the birth of a son, he retorts, “You should add … that my property is now halved, and you would be telling the truth.” Of the Penurious Man (or “The Pennypincher”) we are told, “At a dinner where expenses are shared, he counts the number of cups each person drinks,” and “When his servant breaks a pot or a plate, he deducts the value from his food. If his wife drops a copper, he moves furniture, beds, chests and hunts in the curtains.” “The inner man emerges from this description of externals,” observes Smeed. “There is no abstract analysis.” The form is perfect in and of itself.</p><p>Here is one of Theophrastus’s “characters” quoted in full, to give you a sense of how the shape of the whole small form coheres. “The Gross Man” (or “The Obnoxious Man,” or “Obnoxiousness”) is one of the briefer “characters,” but every sentence is telling.</p><p>Grossness is not hard to define; it is obtrusive and objectionable jesting. The Gross Man is the sort of person who, meeting free-born women, pulls up his clothes and exposes his genitals. At the theatre he goes on clapping when others cease, and hisses the actors whom the public like. In the midst of a general silence he leans back and belches to make everybody turn round. When the market-place is crowded he goes up to the stalls where they sell nuts or myrtle-berries and pilfers from the pile as he talks to the stall-keeper. Somebody he does not know comes by in a hurry—he tells him to stop. Another comes out of court where he has lost an important case—he accosts him and offers congratulations. He goes personally to do his marketing and hire flute-players; he shows his provisions to everybody and invites them to the feast. He stops in front of the barber’s or perfumer’s and tells the customers he is going to get drunk.</p><p>The “sort of person who” structure allows for a list of distinguishing actions and behaviors that describe not a specific individual (what later practitioners and scholars would call a “portrait”) but, rather, a recognizable “type.” The obnoxious man does things like the ones here mentioned. The reader can be relied upon to think up some additional examples to fit the pattern. The generality of the form, and the present tense (“he goes on clapping”; “he stops in front of the barber’s or perfumer’s”), underscores both the typicality of the behavior and the way it might translate into another place or time. (Think “frat party” or “#MeToo.”)</p><p>Marjorie Garber is the William R. Kenan, Jr., Professor of English and of Visual and Environmental Studies at Harvard University.
