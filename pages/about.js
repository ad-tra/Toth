            <p> Hello there, I'm <a href= "https://adtra.me"className="link">Adam</a>I made TOTH in my senior year of high school because I was bored and because I wanted to apply what I learned in my CS classes.</p>
            <p>Since It was my first programing side project, it was kind of crappy. I dind't know any better. TOTH didn't look bad in terms of UI and UX, but a lot of the logic for fetching conent was inconsient and fragile which caused random bugs and frequent iretations. Hopfeully now I know a thing or two on how to make a stable site, therefore I'm revisiting TOTH to make it better and smoother.</p>
