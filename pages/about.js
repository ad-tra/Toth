            <p> Hello there, I'm <a href= "https://adtra.me"className="link">Adam</a>I made TOTH in my senior year of high school because I was bored and because I wanted to apply what I learned in my CS classes.</p>
            <p>Since It was my first programming side project, it was crappy. I didn't know any better. TOTH didn't look bad in terms of UI and UX, but a lot of the logic for fetching content was inconsistent and fragile, which caused random bugs and frequent irritations. Hopefully, now I know a thing or two on how to make a stable site. I'll rewrite TOTH to make it better and smoother. It will help students bypass SAT's agony</p>
