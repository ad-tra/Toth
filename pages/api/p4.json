            "<p>We think we know the story: Charles Darwin hitched a ride on the HMS <em>Beagle</em> to a distant Pacific archipelago called the Galápagos Islands. Looking around, he noticed some, well, peculiar-looking birds and turtles, and <em>voila! </em>In a blinding revelation, the theory of evolution emerged.</p>",
            "<p>In truth, the Galápagos as the hallowed site where evolutionary lightning struck shortchanges Darwin’s real story, and the way science itself progresses. The <em>Beagle</em> spent just five weeks in the Galápagos, out of five-years of global travels, four years of which were in South America. From the journal and field notes Darwin kept, and his letters home, we know that he was taken by the islands, but he recognized nothing paradigm-shattering about them.</p>",
            "<p>The barnacles that obscure Darwin’s history—and that of the theory of evolution—begin with his age: he was just 22 years old when the <em>Beagle </em>left England, and 25 when, in 1835, he visited the Galápagos. It was almost a lifetime later, at age 50, that he published <em>On the Origin of Species</em>.</p>",
            "<p>When the <em>Beagle</em> embarked, Darwin was a novice naturalist. He had recently graduated from Cambridge, with the same bachelor’s degree held by Anglican priests. An invitation from the <em>Beagle</em>’s captain, to serve as a dinner-table conversationalist on topics of natural history, placed him on the ship. He had no formal role in its mission, which was to conduct marine surveys for commercial, military—and only incidentally scientific—purposes.</p>",
            "<p>Darwin departed Britain in 1831 and returned in 1836, with his belief in the immutability of species largely intact. It was only in retrospect, and in particular as he organized his journals for publication and compared notes with other naturalists, that he began to systematically reconsider many past assumptions.</p>",
            "<p>None of his writings from the voyage even make mention of the famous group of passerine species (“Darwin’s finches”) whose beaks and other variations would bolster his later theory of evolution. Indeed, his diary contains only one (passing) reference to <em>any</em> sort of Galápagos finch. But if Darwin didn’t write about the finches while in the Galápagos, he did collect them there, shooting and preparing specimens that he sent to England. In the process, he commingled the birds, failing to record on their labels the specific island on which each had been killed—a lapse in his usual fastidious attention to detail, and one that shows how little attention he was paying to island-to-island diversity. Not until 1837 in London, after the birds’ inspection by zoologist John Gould, did Darwin come to recognize the variations among them.</p>",
            "<p>Similarly, although Darwin noted and recorded the behavior of the massive tortoises on the islands, their differences didn’t strike him until the governor of the Galápagos brought them to his attention. And as with the birds, it was another scientist, the French herpetologist Gabriel Bibron (studying specimens from other Galápagos expeditions) who later confirmed for him those variances.</p>",
            "<p>Late in life, Darwin was asked directly whether he had been an evolutionist during his <em>Beagle</em> travels: “I believed in the permanence of Species,” he answered, “but, as far as I can remember, vague doubts occasionally flitted across my mind. … But I did not become convinced that species were mutable until, I think, two or three years had elapsed.”</p>"
