They had a stolen <a href=\"https://www.dekooning.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Willem de Kooning</a> painting worth $160 million hanging behind their bedroom door.</p>",
            "<p>The couple’s purported double lives as high-stakes art thieves has <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-best-reads/2018/08/01/art-heist-woman-ochre-clues-emerge-willem-de-kooning-painting-recovered/789652002/\" target=\"_blank\">made headlines</a> ever since their prized painting was identified as a missing de Kooning <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/09/nyregion/a-de-kooning-a-theft-and-an-enduring-mystery.html\" target=\"_blank\">in 2017</a>. Now, reports Vivie Behrens for the <a href=\"https://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2022-03-11/in-the-thief-collector-thrill-seeking-fantasies-turn-to-criminal-delusions/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Austin Chronicle</em></a>, a new documentary titled <em><a href=\"https://deadline.com/video/the-thief-collector-sxsw-documentary-trailer-director-allison-otto-video/\" target=\"_blank\">The Thief Collector</a></em> attempts to answer the <em>why</em> of the story: namely, why would a husband and wife described by friends as “not exactly thrill-seekers,” in the words of <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/the-thief-collector-de-kooning-heist-review-1234622038/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>ARTnews</em></a>’<em> </em>Alex Greenberger,<strong> </strong>pull off such a heist? And were the Alters hiding other, even darker secrets?</p>",
            "<p>Directed by <a href=\"https://www.allisonotto.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Allison Otto</a>, the documentary premiered at the <a href=\"https://www.sxsw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">South by Southwest</a> Film Festival earlier this month. As Otto tells the <em>Austin Chronicle</em>, she first came across the couple’s story in a 2018 <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/photograph-offers-link-between-retired-couple-and-160-million-stolen-de-kooning-180969963/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Smithsonian </em>magazine</a><em> </em>article. After digging into the mystery a bit more by speaking with the Alters’ family members, she realized that she’d stumbled onto a “much, much deeper story.” The Alters, she adds, were “much more complicated” than previously reported.</p>",
            "<p>“I was haunted by this story for months after I first found out about it,” Otto says. “This is not your traditional true crime story. … [The documentary] makes you wonder how well do you really know those around you, and how far would you personally go for something that you covet?”</p>",
            "<p>To create the documentary, Otto and a team of editors sorted through 11,797 slides and hours of 8 mm film footage from the family’s photography and home video collections. The snapshots showed a couple who’d somehow managed to travel to 140 countries on public school teaching salaries, according to Danny Udero of the <em><a href=\"https://www.scsun-news.com/story/news/crime/2018/01/03/mystery-remains-how-160-million-dollar-painting-got-bedroom-cliff/1002575001/\" target=\"_blank\">Silver City Sun-News</a></em>. They had over $1 million in their bank account at the time of their deaths. (Jerry died in 2012, while Rita died in 2017.) Interestingly, a picture of the Alters at a 1985 Thanksgiving dinner in Tucson, Arizona, placed them in the same city as the de Kooning painting the day before it was stolen.</p>",
            "<p>The couple has never been officially linked to the artwork’s theft from the University of Arizona <a href=\"https://artmuseum.arizona.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of Art</a>. According to a <a href=\"https://news.arizona.edu/story/uas-unsolved-case-stolen-painting\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> from the university, a man and a woman entered the museum around 9 a.m. on November 29, 1985. While the woman spoke with a security guard, the man went up to the second floor, where he cut de Kooning’s <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2019/11/27/what-know-de-koonings-woman-ochre-painting-stolen-university-arizona/4307278002/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Woman-Ochre</em></a><em> </em>(1955)<em> </em>from its frame, rolled it up and hid it under a garment. The pair quickly left the museum some 15 minutes after arriving, with the stolen painting in tow.
